            <br /><p></p><p>1. You hear a loud clatter from one of the fan units of a machine you're servicing. An Amber FAN light at the front of the machine is on. The other FAN is stopped completely. You know intuitively that:</p><p>2. It's 11pm, you're in bed and get a call about a faulty disk drive. Your immediate response is:</p><p>3. 24 x 7 x 4 means:</p><p>4. You're called into a job to service piece of kit you've never ever seen before. You don't even know what it does. You:</p><p>5. After E, above you put the kit back together and have a large box of spares left over. However, the green light still comes on when you press the power button. You:</p><p>6. You're called out because an earth leakage detector is tripping on a piece of your kit. You:</p><p>7. You have NO F***ING IDEA what is wrong with a piece of kit you're servicing. You:</p><p>8. The phrase "No user serviceable parts inside" means:</p><p>9. "Warranty VOID if Seal Broken" means"</p><p>10. Ohms Law states that two resistors in Parallel are:</p><p>How did you do then?
Mostly A You're obviously not an engineer - it's patently obvious. You're too honest and know too much. You must be stopped.</p><p>Mostly B You too know too much for your own, or your company's good. Stick to your graduate studies and leave the real world alone.</p><p>Mostly C Honesty with occasional flashes of insight. You must do better if you want to enter the fast pace charge-now-ask-questions-later world of engineering</p><p>Mostly D You've got what it takes, but you don't really know how to use it. You need to sharpen those skills a little till you're at peak performance</p><p>Mostly E A large number of important vendors would snap you up in a trice. You have the special blend of non-accountability, blatant irresponsibility and ignorance that will make you invaluable to any organisation that chooses to employ you! Good work!!!</p><p>Didn't do well? Perhaps you'll do better in Part Two - coming soon. ®</p><p>BOFH: Kit and Caboodle
