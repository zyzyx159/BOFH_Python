    <p> BOFH 2000: Episode 6</p>
    <p>So we've got a visitor in at Mission Control for the next couple of days who's going to upgrade the main
        financial software package that the company uses.</p>
    <p>And wouldn't you know it, his hourly rate (I happen to notice, when his briefcase accidentally falls open after I
        trip and insert a paperclip into its lock) is such that it brings a tear to even MY trained eye -- and I, not
        being unversed in the arts of extortion and general larceny -- am fairly hard to surprise.</p>
    <p>Of course, his disguising it as a DAILY RATE gives the impression, to naive types (The Boss, The H.O.D and
        Technical Contracts Group), that you're getting a lot more for your money that 7.5 hours. Well, 4.5 if we're to
        be completely honest and subtract food/beverage and newspaper breaks.</p>
    <p>However, as they say, you're paid for what you know, not what you do...</p>
    <p>"So what you're saying is that he's extremely overpaid?" the PFY asks when I explain these facts to him.</p>
    <p>"Why do you say that?"</p>
    <p>"Cos he knows bugger all!"</p>
    <p>"Well he won't be a computing jack-of-all-trades like us -- his forte is no doubt the accounting application and
        it's installation."</p>
    <p>"So why's he reading the upgrade documentation?"</p>
    <p>"A lot of this stuff is highly complex, with hundreds of pre-upgrade procedures to be carried out," I remind him.
        "So he's probably performing the checklists. What section is he reading at the moment?"</p>
    <p>"The introduction -- entitled 'How to use this documentation'."</p>
    <p>"Well, he's probably..."</p>
    <p>"He's been reading it for an hour now.."</p>
    <p>"Ah"</p>
    <p>"Ah?"</p>
    <p>"Ah. Meaning, it sounds like we've got a suck-it-and-see upgrader."</p>
    <p>"Suck it and see?"</p>
    <p>"The old-fashioned way of checking if mains cable was live"</p>
    <p>"You'd suck a cable?"</p>
    <p>"Don't be silly -- that's dangerous! You'd get an apprentice to do it!"</p>
    <p>"Oh. So what does it mean now?"</p>
    <p>"It means I think he'll skim the upgrade text, ensure we have a complete backup of the system, then rush blindly
        into the upgrade, accepting all defaults -- KNOWING that he can recover the data if needed.</p>
    <p>"Ah."</p>
    <p>"Precisely. And if it works, he comes out looking smokingly good at his job, if not there's 'some incompatibility
        with our software or with the upgrade pack' and we roll back."</p>
    <p>"Rollback?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, it's a nice way of saying that you've made a pig's breakfast of the whole thing and want the evidence
        erased by a recovery."</p>
    <p>"Has anyone ever called you cynical?"</p>
    <p>"They may have, but they're just bitter.."</p>
    <p>Our conversation ends seconds later with the reappearance of the person concerned, complete with upgrade manual
        and highlighter pen.</p>
    <p>"Ah, just checking that you've taken a full system backup before I start."</p>
    <p>"Sure have!" I lie, nudging the snapshot tapes into the bin as he leaves the room.</p>
    <p>...Several Hours later...</p>
    <p>"I'm afraid we'll need to rollback the upgrade"</p>
    <p>"Oh, why's that?"</p>
    <p>"Looks like there's an incompatibility between your revision of the Database code and the version the upgrader
        expects" he murmurs.</p>
    <p>The needle on my desktop Bollockometer wanders off-scale for a moment or ten.</p>
    <p>"Sure," I cry, grabbing a tape from the pile of read-errored duds on my desk.</p>
    <p>..10 Minutes Later...</p>
    <p>"I'm afraid the tape we wrote has read errors and is unrecoverable," I report.</p>
    <p>"I..." he gasps. "Didn't you read it to verify it?"</p>
    <p>"Of course" I respond, ignoring the ticking sound as the Bollockometer clocks itself "but my guess is that the
        read pass must have been the straw that broke the camel's back -- media-wise!"</p>
    <p>"Can't you recover ANY of the data?"</p>
    <p>"Nope, the error's at the beginning of the tape -- as you'd expect of the most used area of magnetic media," I
        burble.</p>
    <p>"Oh dear," he says, only minorly apologetic. "Our statement of indemnity clearly states that we're not
        responsi.."</p>
    <p>"Statement of indemnity?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, as a matter of course we get a signatory from our clients to indemnify us if there are problems as a result
        of the upgrade. I have it with me in my brie.. ..Hmm, it's in here somewhe..."</p>
    <p>"Oh dear. Don't tell me you've forgotten to get an indemnity form signed. And I just BET you're a private
        contractor who signed an indemnity form with your agency indemnifying THEM ?"</p>
    <p>"I..."</p>
    <p>"Which means it'll be you *personally* that our company will be pursuing for damages..."</p>
    <p>"I..."</p>
    <p>"Unless, of course... But then..."</p>
    <p>"Unless what?!?!?!"</p>
    <p>"Well unless of course you re-enter all the data from the ruined tables into the database before the beancounters
        get in the morning..."</p>
    <p>"But the corrupt table's got about 200,000 rows!"</p>
    <p>"Yep, it'd take ages to re-enter. Unless you somehow managed to bribe all the women in our D.P. Pool to do it for
        you..."</p>
    <p>"COULD I?!?!" he gasps.</p>
    <p>"I dunno -- sounds a bit pricey to me!" the PFY chirps, right on time "You'd be lookingat, I dunno, a couple of
        grand."</p>
    <p>"I can manage two thousand pounds!" he blurts.</p>
    <p>"Ah, that would be THREE thousand pounds -- by the time my assistant, myself,and the Head of DP are taken into
        account."</p>
    <p>"Would you take a ch.."</p>
    <p>"CASH. If you hurry you could get it before the banks close and the DP staff leave."</p>
    <p>It takes about 10 minutes for him to rocket out of the building and collect the wherewithal to make the
        transaction. I assure him the DP people will work till it's done, or take the blame themselves for the error --
        which appeases his distress largely.</p>
    <p>As soon as he's gone, I slip the PFY his share (500 quid) ignoring his protestations.</p>
    <p>"Was it YOU who split the disk mirror this very morning?" I ask whilst invalidating the data on the upgrade disk
        with a few well-placed keystrokes and bringing the old version Online with only a few more. "Was it YOU who
        stole the indemnity form from his briefcase? I think not! You got paid for your two parts in this -- your
        estimate of the DP Pool cost at the right moment.."</p>
    <p>"And?"</p>
    <p>"Those pints you're about to buy me!"</p>
    <p>"Of course!" Â®</p>
