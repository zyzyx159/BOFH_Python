            <br /><p> BOFH 2000: Episode 37</p><p>"..Well I think in that case, perhaps we should get a specialist in!" The Boss counters in response to the sad news that neither The PFY nor I know a single thing about 'e-tail' - and are unlikely to want to learn in the foreseeable future. "In fact I might know just the man. Worked with him in Beirut you know!"</p><p>"The HEART of Electronic Retail!" The PFY comments dryly.</p><p>"That's got nothing to do with it! Anyway, he wasn't in computing then, he was repairing planes!"</p><p>"So he's more of a commuting professional that a computing professional?" I chuckle, unable to resist a quick aside now that there's blood in the water.</p><p>"Of course not! That was years ago! No, now he's VERY thick in computing."</p><p>"As opposed to being thick AT computing?" the PFY asks, not at all subtly..</p><p>"LOOK, HE'S THE MAN I TELL YOU! And I'm *GETTING* him in!" The Boss cries, making his executive decision.</p><p>. . .</p><p>"Cowboy!" I predict to The PFY once we're in the safe confines of mission control.</p><p>"He didn't sound THAT ba.."</p><p>"Mark my words, he'll have his own mini-screwdriver set - which he's had since the airplane days, AND which has been used to repair computers when he did THAT for a living - and will come complete with sets of acronyms and buzzwords that no-one's ever heard before."</p><p>"I still thi.."</p><p>"He's the sort that makes friends with Management and excuses for stuff-ups. He'll be gone in a week, the project will be deader than Beta Video AND we'll be blamed for its failure, for not working in with him!"</p><p>"Why don't we wait and se.."</p><p>"100 quid?" I ask, choosing stakes designed to engender a bit of forethought.</p><p>"Deal!" The PFY cries, largely bypassing the thought bit in pursuit of prospective readies.</p><p>. . .</p><p>I don't know what it is about The PFY that makes him such a sucker for a wager. Whatever it is, it can't be good for him however, and I feel it's my duty to take his money to ensure he learns.</p><p>. . .</p><p>And MY money's looking pretty good a day later when Jim, our new contracted expert turns up - as luck would have it, between jobs at the moment.</p><p>No surprises there.</p><p>"So, they tell me you're a bit of a wiz at this online retail stuff," I mention in passing, once we've got the introductory formalities out of the way.</p><p>"Online Retail?" He asks blankly.</p><p>"Yes, you know E-tail, E-Commerce?"</p><p>"No, I - OH! You mean Internet-Based Commercial Marketing, as we like to call it!"</p><p>"'We' being?"</p><p>"Oh, just us in-the-trade people."</p><p>The PFY can see his 100 quid disappearing down the tubes and decides to give Jim a couple of hints to help him along his way.</p><p>"You'll be wanting to see the commerce servers we've got, along with our certificated web servers and bank interface then?" he asks.</p><p>What a cheat!</p><p>"No, no, I find that stuff all takes care of itself, we need some flashy moving-type images to draw people to the electronic company marketing site."</p><p>"Animated gifs will bring people to our website from far and wide?" I ask, whilst showing the PFY the space I've just made in my wallet for his money.. "That's a little har.."</p><p>"Obviously a well-tailored portal would encourage confidence in customers," The PFY chips, just as The Boss shows up.</p><p>"See!" The Boss cries, hearing only some semi-positive statements. "I knew he'd be just the man for the job. Now, what sort of delivery time are we looking at?"</p><p>"Should be up and running inside a week," Jim responds, pulling a ridiculous figure out of his backside.</p><p>ONE WEEK LATER</p><p>"..because they don't seem to want to help install the software!" Jim burbles "But I SUPPOSE if I do it MYSELF we can have it all sorted out inside a week..."</p><p>"Oh I'm sure I can COUNT on these two to help you out" the Boss murmurs, in a tone intended to imply our lack of choice in the matter.</p><p>ONE DAY LATER</p><p>"It's fantastic!" The Boss cries, surveying the website which has more plagiarised content on it than your average WareZ zone. "Those moving pictures really DO draw the eye, don't they."</p><p>"Like a road accident," I agree. "It's only a pity Jim couldn't be here to see it. Where did he say he was again?"</p><p>"Oh, he left a message saying something about popping back to Beirut for a bit - apparently he's packed up and moved on - but not before completing this."</p><p>ONE MINUTE LATER</p><p>"And you're really going to let Jim take the credit?"</p><p>"For the website containing large amounts of copyright images and content, some of which is bound to result in legal action. Yes, I think so!"</p><p>"But he also gets paid for it!"</p><p>"True. But then he'll need money when he gets to Beirut..."</p><p>"But did he really go to Beirut?" The PFY asks suspiciously. "It all sounds a little shady to me."</p><p>"I can almost guarantee he's going to Beirut. Eventually."</p><p>MEANWHILE, IN A PACKING CRATE AT HEATHROW, INSIDE A CRATE LABELLED "LIVE ANIMAL EXPORTS"</p><p>"MMMmmmMMMMF!!!"</p><p>"MMMMMmmmMMMMMMMMM MMM M MMMMMMFFF!"</p><p>"MMMMMMMMMFMFMFMMMMFFF!"</p><p>Mind you, 100 quid is, after all, 100 quid. ®</p><p>BOFH 2K: Kit and Caboodle
