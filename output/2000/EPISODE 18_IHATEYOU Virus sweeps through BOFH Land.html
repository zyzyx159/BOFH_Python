            <h3>EPISODE 18 </h3>
            <br /><p> b>BOFH 2000: Episode 18</p><p>It's not even midday when the boss trundles into the office when I'm barely into my morning paper. True, I'm a bit behind - having taken a reasonable amount of time out to examine the exceptional colour rendition that can be achieved these days on low grade paper.</p><p>"This page three girl is so lifelike you almost think she's real!" I comment to the PFY, who looks up from his financial broadsheet (the sad bastard) with a measure of distaste.</p><p>"Yes yes, you say that most days," he responds, tucking his gaze back into who's screwing who pages of the drier of the morning's reading.</p><p>"But look at that high quality dithering!" I cry.</p><p>"Um" the boss interrupts - while we're on the topic of dithering - "If you're not busy..."</p><p>His trepidation is well-placed, as history has proven that I'm not at my most congenial before my quadruple espresso breakfast.</p><p>"Yes?" I ask pleasantly, breaking the habit of a lifetime and trying the passive approach.</p><p>"It's about this ILOVEYOU thing."</p><p>"Don't be disgusting - you're not my type. You're not even the right sex!"</p><p>"No, the Virus."</p><p>"HIV? Well, I applaud your honesty in these trying times, but..."</p><p>"Not me, the email virus, ILOVEYOU!"</p><p>"Oh that"</p><p>"Yes! What are we going to do about it?"</p><p>"Well the PFY and I have been discussing this at length and we believe that we will trust our users to follow the simple instructions that we've given them time and time again - which is 'Don't open attachments from people you don't know'"</p><p>"That's all very well, but someone's bound to do it," he adds worriedly.</p><p>"So you've infected your desktop?" I sigh.</p><p>"Uh, no - the secretary's. She asked me to see if it was the Virus."</p><p>"So you opened it to check?"</p><p>"Ah.. well.."</p><p>"Well indeed. Looks like our Windows 2000 project has a pilot victim. I mean test subject."</p><p>"Is there nothing we can do?"</p><p>"Apart from not opening attachments that is?"</p><p>"Uh, yes"</p><p>"Not really - a reinstall is far easier, just to be sure."</p><p>"Oh, well could you prepare some documentation about this for noticeboards and the like?"</p><p>"I suppose we could, but we're really a bit more concerned about the 'IHATEYOU' virus and what will happen if THAT gets here."</p><p>"The IHATEYOU virus? What's that?" he gasps horrified.</p><p>"Well it's a derivative of the ILOVEYOU virus, only it's effects are far more damaging"</p><p>"ARE THEY?" he gasps</p><p>"Oh yes. It looks like a Notepad document, but in fact does all the usual stuff plus more. From memory, it scrambles your NT Registry - admittedly, Microsoft did get there ahead of time; randomly reschedules any netmeetings you have... EVERY time you login; uh, sends the entire contents of your "Sent Items" and "InBox" folders to everyone in your address book - which, I might add, is especially bad if you've got any personal correspondence that you haven't clea...</p><p>The Boss gasps perceptibly at that one.</p><p>"...ned up; and, um, prints every jpeg in the cache folders of your browser to every defined printer - which can also be bad if you've been to any porn sites in the last two mo..."</p><p>The boss rockets out of the room at top speed, no doubt with an unplugging mission in mind.</p><p>"I take it you sent him a message with IHATEYOU, in the Subject?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"THREE messages to be precise. With an attachment Notepad document entitled '10 reasons why I hate you'."</p><p>"What was in it?"</p><p>"Just 'Because you're a plonker' 10 times over.."</p><p>"No virus?"</p><p>"Nah, too much effort. It's far better this way. Though it's a pity he ran off so quickly as I was just about to mention that it responds to all new mail with 'Sod off you pretentious tosser'!"</p><p>"Save it for later?"</p><p>"You betcha! Now all we've got to do is forward the contents of those folders from his backup share to everyone in the building and print a load of porn about the place"</p><p>"So I should just slap a couple of dozen images from the smut archive off to some printers randomly?"</p><p>"Yeah... NO! No, go to the Web and get a swag of gay stuff. That way when they start printing we can act like we always knew he was like that after his professions of love earlier in the day"</p><p>"He'll deny it came from his machine!"</p><p>"Sure he will. As an excuse I don't think "I only browse straight porn" is going to cut much with the higher echelons."</p><p>...</p><p>"Honestly, it has NOTHING to do with me!" the boss pleads, as the PFY and I look on suspiciously.</p><p>"Of course it wasn't," I respond kindly. "Now are you sure there isn't something you'd like to tell us?"</p><p>"Those AREN'T my pictures!"</p><p>"No, that wasn't what I was hoping you'd tell us."</p><p>"What were you hoping I'd tell you?" he asks, confused.</p><p>"Well, I was HOPING that you'd tell us that you were very sorry for disturbing our morning paper and that it won't happen again."</p><p>"I..." he starts, as it sinks in "YOU did this!?"</p><p>"All water under the bridge now!" I cry. "And unless you want the printing logs from this morning - with YOUR machine name ALL OVER them - finding their way into the Head of IT's hot little public-enquiry orientated grasp..."</p><p>"Yes!" he gasps, thinking of his job prospects if the Old Boy's network gets a hold of a rumour like that.</p><p>"You'll be off down to Caffe Uno for a quadruple espresso, and a double for the assistant."</p><p>"All right," he sighs, resignedly.</p><p>"..for the next fortnight."</p><p>"Yes..."</p><p>It's a dirty job, but someone's got to do it...
