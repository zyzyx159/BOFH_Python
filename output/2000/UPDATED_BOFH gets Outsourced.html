            <br /><p> BOFH 2000: Episode 32</p><p>"Outsourcing!" The Boss and Head of IT chuckle delightedly to each other as they roll, in tandem, into Mission Control. "It's brilliant!"</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>"No it's not!" I cry, looking up from the Games Patch page I'm currently engrossed in, "We get some outsourcing company in here, let them charge us through the nose for a per-call support contract, seeing them one day a week - if that - and in the end we'll have to take on more staff to fix the problems they cause because they don't know the infrastructure! It's giving someone a licence to print money!"</p><p>"That's just the point! It's a Goldmine! We can make a fortune!!!"</p><p>"*MAKE* a fortune?!"</p><p>"Yes, there's bound to be a ton of companies out there who need the skills that you and your assistant have!"</p><p>"Sorry, you're suggesting that you outsource US?"</p><p>"Yes! We'll just contract out your spare time. You know, the time you waste browsing the Internet."</p><p>"Keeping abreast of the industry you mean?"</p><p>"Or two breasts, if your assistant's browsing is anything to go by" the Head of IT remarks, unable to drag his eyes from the pink hues emanating from The PFY's screen.</p><p>"I'm actually reviewing the content of the web-cache to determine it's feasibility for company business!" the PFY responds - aggression set to STUN - appearing from behind a bookshelf.</p><p>"Web-cache?"</p><p>"Yes, I'm determining WHY the Cache always appears to be full of images instead of any information related to work. When I've a complete list of the users downloading the images we'll be able to save a mass of network bandwidth AND MORE IMPORTANTLY make an estimate of the amount of time they spend browsing porn in a day instead of working for the company."</p><p>"I hardly think that's a valid use of your time," The Boss responds nervously.</p><p>"Yes, I can't see that there's any call for this sort of make-work activity!" The Head of IT concurs, equally nervously. "In fact I think you should cease this sort of activity - we're paying you for your technical expertise, not to embark on some form of witchhunt!"
. . .</p><p>Any doubt in our minds about the source of the material in question disappears in a flash...</p><p>"And that's exactly the point!" The Boss cries, clambering up to the moral high ground."You have free time which we could be recovering revenue from!"</p><p>Within a day an outsourcing deal is struck with some old-school chum of the Head of IT with shabby technical support. The PFY and I are completely against the idea until we find out that the company is in fact a modelling agency with a free lunch bar. Fashionably clad models in need of IT support need the professional services that only The PFY and I can provide...</p><p>[Later that same day]</p><p>"Well here we are!" Brian, our new subcontracted boss cries proudly,indicating a mass of machines and cables laid all over the place in a rather warm office.</p><p>"A pig's breakfast in other words," I say, gazing at the mess unfolding before me.</p><p>"NO!" a furry-toothed geeky type cries from behind us. "Every system is in top working condition - I know, I installed them all."</p><p>"If by 'installed' you mean stacked them on any free horizontal surface - yes, you have done well. But no airconditioning, no UPS - the whole place could go tits up at any moment!" the PFY cries.</p><p>"I hardly think that's a likely occ..." the geeky type starts.</p><p>"There's not even a lock on the door!", I cry "Why, any disgruntled former model with a face like a camel's backside and bitter about it could just wander in here and turn the kit off! I'm actually surprised that no-one' stripped over a power cable and brought the lot down before now!"</p><p>. . .</p><p>A quick "woopsy" from the PFY later (always quick to take a hint) and Brian has accidentally stepped backwards onto the reset switch of a plugbox which he probably could have sworn wasn't there a few seconds before...</p><p>Such is the ability of a computing professional to foretell the future..</p><p>Proof positive of our technical ability, Brian immediately converts to the side of good.</p><p>"My goodness! It's a timebomb! All our model and contract info is on those machines! It's worth a fortune!"</p><p>"We'll need a computer room," I warn Brian.</p><p>"Of course!"</p><p>"Some place that's well-airconditioned and has a healthy amount of electrical wiring, as opposed to a jury-rigged office," The PFY suggests, "Preferrably somewhere that we can put a couple of vertical racks in.."</p><p>"I don't think we have anywhere like that here - we've only got three floors of the building," Brian responds.</p><p>"Somewhere with a LOT of LIGHT too?" the PFY prompts, "so we're easily able to keep an eye on the servers?"</p><p>"No, can't think of anythi.."</p><p>"Perhaps with a lot of SPACE surrounding it, in case of airconditioning problems..."</p><p>"THE BASEMENT!" Brian cries, "A STOREROOM!!!"</p><p>"Danger of flooding," I offer. "Also, we'd need somewhere with RESTRICTED ACCESS.."</p><p>"THE PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO!" Brian cries, finally taking the hints!</p><p>"Of course!" the PFY cries, sucking up so energetically he'll be needing a dustbag shortly "Why didn't I think of that!?!"</p><p>. . .</p><p>And the worst thing about outsourcing is it's all WORK, WORK, WORK!</p><p>No sooner have we set ourselves up in business (took a while for the geek to carry all the kit up the stairwell [because someone convinced Brian of the electrostatic dangers of lifts]) than we're called out to look at access problems, and wouldn't you bloody know it, there's a swimsuit shoot on and the problem is so intermittent that it looks like we're going to have to hang around the place till the problem recurs.</p><p>Ah well, that's the price you pay, I guess.
