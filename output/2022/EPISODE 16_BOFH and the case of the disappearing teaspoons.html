            <h3>EPISODE 16 </h3>
            <br /><p> There's nothing I like more than a chat with an expert. So many people have vague and uninformed opinions about things, it's good to talk to someone with experience who knows what they're talking about. I can hardly wait.</p><p>"And so, when it detects movement, it sends you a text message with the picture."</p><p>"Like that picture?" the PFY asks, looking at the proffered phone. "What is it, 720p?"</p><p>"Oh I can't remember the model number, but it's a fantastic piece of kit."</p><p>"Apparently," the PFY replies. "So what, you think we should put these up all over the building?"</p><p>"It's a thought." </p><p>"So I'd get, what, maybe 200 text messages an hour until you located the person who's taking all the teaspoons?"</p><p>"I …"</p><p>"IF we could recognize them at a distance with such low resolution."</p><p>"Yes but …"</p><p>"IF they weren't hiding them in their pockets."</p><p>"I …"</p><p>"And IF the camera wasn't solar powered in the first place."</p><p>"Well obviously you could buy a powered one." the Boss snips.</p><p>"Or maybe install a sunlamp to power the solar-power camera. OR we could just buy some more teaspoons."</p><p>"WE ALREADY BOUGHT MORE TEASPOONS LAST YEAR AND NOW THEY'RE GONE TOO!"</p><p>"And you're thinking if we install all these cameras and watch them night and day we'll eventually catch the master criminal who's stealing a teaspoon every … what, couple of months?"</p><p>"THAT'S NOT THE POINT!"</p><p>"Have you thought about tracking the teaspoons?" I suggest.</p><p>"Tracking them?"</p><p>"Yeah. Put a GPS tracker on the spoons."</p><p>"Can you do that?" he gasps, in clear danger of wetting himself in his excitement.</p><p>"Sure. We'd need to get a teaspoon with a fairly large handle to put the tracker in, but I think we could do it."</p><p>"That sounds great."</p><p>"Oh, but hang on, we won't get any budget to do that," the PFY says.</p><p>"Just use the miscellaneous expenses budget," the Boss suggests offhandedly.</p><p>"Oh, we spent that all on getting our SSL keys recut at the locksmith and then getting our hard drives hardened," I chip in.</p><p>"I guess I could maybe swing some money from my miscellaneous budget," he offers.</p><p>"Fine, it'll only cost a couple of hundred quid – in cash – to get the trackers plus whatever it'll cost for the big-handled teaspoons …"</p><p>"Cash?"</p><p>"Yeah, well, you probably don't want a paper trail if you're buying personal trackers."</p><p>"Ah, yes. Good point."</p><p>… a week and 200 quids' worth of lagers later …</p><p>"That's amazing," the Boss gushes, rolling a teaspoon over. "You can't even see where you opened it. How did you glue it back together?"</p><p>"With thermal paste," I say. "The good stuff."</p><p>"How do I switch it on?" he asks.</p><p>"It's already on." </p><p>"And … how does it work?"</p><p>"We installed an app on your phone which will alert you when a spoon leaves the tearoom," I say. "Plus or minus 15 meters."</p><p>"So … I could …" he says, leaving the tearoom.</p><p>Moments later I hear his phone ping distantly down the corridor.</p><p>"This is GREAT!" he enthuses, returning to the room. "But does it work outside the building?"</p><p>"Outside the building it should be even better. It'll locate the spoon to within three meters, give or take, because the signal's not impaired by the concrete in the building."</p><p>"I'm going to try this!" he says, breaking for the exit.</p><p>Half an hour later he's back.</p><p>"THIS IS AMAZING!" he cries. "It sent me a message every ten minutes with the location of the spoon. It's only a matter of time – we'll find the spoon thief!"</p><p>Or maybe not. It's only a matter of time before the Boss realizes that the find-my-spoon app is really a find-this-phone app and the game's up. And it's a bit dependant on knowing when a spoon leaves the room, which is where the PFY's tearoom camera has been so useful. Streaming the boss's camera and mic feeds back to us is also useful …</p><p>The next day the Boss is back in Mission Control.</p><p>"This isn't working," he says. "I had Steve take a spoon with him when he went to get pizzas yesterday and nothing happened."</p><p>"He can't have been using the right spoon," the PFY says, in a stroke of genius.</p><p>"The right spoon?"</p><p>"Yeah, only one of them is tracked because of the high cost of the subminiature trackers."</p><p>"Can't you track them all?"</p><p>"If you've got another thousand quid."</p><p>The Boss balks at spending more cash on tech to track spoons, and we're in the clear. Until …</p><p>… the next day …</p><p>"I sent Steve back to the pizza place last night with ALL the spoons and nothing happened!" he fumes.</p><p>"Really?" the PFY responds, looking up from his desk. "That is unusual.  But wait – you didn't put the spoon in the dishwasher did you – it's not dishwasher safe!"</p><p>"I …  Wha … OK, I think we should open all these spoons up so I can see that tracker."</p><p>"Yes, you're probably right," I say, stalling. "We need to know whether this is an intermittent problem or whether the dishwasher is doing harm – as I thought we used the dishwasher in conjunction with hot beverages to heat the thermocouple to charge the tracker."</p><p>"We did," the PFY concurs, still tapping away on his desktop, "as well as a tiny autogyro to convert the stirring movement into electricity. Maybe it's just been idle too long."</p><p>"Steve took them ALL with him when he >PING!<"</p><p>"What's that?" I ask. "Is spoon back online?"</p><p>"It … seems so," the Boss says. "And it's just outside the building."</p><p>The boss dashes off while the PFY continues to feed coordinates into the phone.</p><p>…</p><p>It was just a matter of time, really.   </p><p>Sooner or later if you're focused on your phone screen instead of your surroundings you're bound to forget to look both ways before crossing the street.</p><p>"There's been a terrible accident," the PFY says, closing his mapping app.</p><p>…</p>
