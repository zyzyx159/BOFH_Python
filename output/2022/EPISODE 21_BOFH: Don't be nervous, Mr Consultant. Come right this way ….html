            <h2>Simon and the PFY take a closer look at a 'routine' data translation costs bill </h2>
            <h3>EPISODE 21 </h3>
            <br /><p> "Simon, Stephen, this is Gerard, Daniel, David and, uhhh, Karl."</p><p>The Boss adds: "They're the implementation team for the new financial system rollout and just want to do some preliminary planning."</p><p>"What new financial system?" I ask.</p><p>"What rollout?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"The financial system rollout!" the Boss snaps back. "You came to a meeting about it six months ago."</p><p>"And we're implementing a new financial system based on a single meeting six months ago?"</p><p>"You apparently agreed we should proceed with the project. They've made inroads!"</p><p>"Was that the meeting with the small pies?" I ask.</p><p>"Small pies?" the Boss asks, blankly.</p><p>"Yeah, small pies," the PFY says. "Apricot – and apple. Very nice."</p><p>"I don't know if there were pies or not, but it's hardly material."</p><p>"It is to me" the PFY says. "If I go to a planning meeting with consultants and there's no food …"</p><p>"… he'd have to make plans to medicate himself because of his diabetes-induced rage," I finish, before the PFY can disclose our SOP of not turning up to meetings with no food.</p><p>"Diabetes-induced rage?" the Boss asks, dubiously.</p><p>"It's a medical condition. It's in his HR file," I lie – temporarily.</p><p>The Boss looks around shiftily, then decides that he doesn't need to ring HR to challenge this fabrication just yet.</p><p>"He needs to have sugar, or he can get a bit belligerent," I lie.  "Remember that incident with the brick under the table when those sales guys ended up in hospital?"</p><p>Sugar has no noticeable effect on the PFY's belligerence. He has a resting belligerence level of about 87 percent, which increases rapidly in the presence of software salespeople.</p><p>"And it turns out there's a surprising amount of sugar in lager," I suggest, "which is how he medicated himself before that meeting."</p><p>"He fell asleep on the table," the Boss says drily.</p><p>"Diabetic coma," I shoot back.</p><p>"That doesn't explain why you were drinking."</p><p>"I didn't want him to develop a substance abuse problem by drinking alone." </p><p>"And what, you had a sympathetic diabetic coma?"</p><p>"I have no recollection of those events. But what concerns me is that you're implementing a financial system on the basis of a single meeting."</p><p>"We've had DOZENS of meetings!" the Boss snaps.</p><p>"Really? Was there food at them?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Ah, right then, as you were."</p><p>"So Gerard, Daniel, David and, um, Karl would like to get started today."</p><p>"Really. So if that's the product, what's the implementation cost?"</p><p>"Implementation is included," Karl says. "It's in the contract."</p><p>The Boss's smugness level appears to increase.</p><p>"So it's all paid for?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Everything?" I ask.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Even data transformation issues."</p><p>"Well, I mean, data transformation would be an additional cost. We can't price around what we don't know," Karl says.</p><p>"But you have seen the data?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"And you know the format you'd be expecting?"</p><p>"I … Yes."</p><p>"So you'd know the transformations?"</p><p>"Well yes. But there's encoding, bounds checking – you know the story."</p><p>"I DO know the story alright – including the unhappy ending."</p><p>The Boss's smugness is disappearing faster than … fruit pies at a consultants' meeting.</p><p>"Well we have a preliminary figure," he admits, sliding a folded piece of paper over to me.</p><p>As any good divorce lawyer or redundancy consultant will tell you, few things signal a monumental shafting quite as well as a folded sheet of paper.</p><p>I open it a crack to let the horror trickle out in the Boss's direction.  I'm a little disappointed that the page doesn't concertina out. That's what I'd have done, to maximize the effect.</p><p>To his credit, the Boss doesn't start weeping immediately – but then I haven't asked the guys about ongoing license fees or maintenance contracts yet. There's still time.</p><p>"That seems a little steep for just executing a perl script," the PFY says after turning the page around.</p><p>"There's a lot more to it than that!" Karl replies.</p><p>"Yes, the uh, encoding, bounds checking, parsnip insurance, burnishing fees and the like," the PFY says.</p><p>"They're just routine data translation costs," Karl says. "We have this with every contract."</p><p>"Yet they're not included in your 'comprehensive' contract?" I ask.</p><p>"It's not possible to include them as each data translation is different from the last."</p><p>"They're not even mentioned in your comprehensive contract, are they?" the PFY ask.</p><p>"Some clients don't need them."</p><p>"So you can name some former clients that haven't had to pay an additional  – and exorbitant – fee?" I ask.</p><p>"Uh …"</p><p>"We'll take that as a no," I say as the PFY taps away on his tablet. "And if you would, I think my assistant has a counter offer."</p><p>"Which is?" Karl asks.</p><p>"Just give him a moment while he folds the paper …"</p><p>It slides across the table …</p><p>"What was the counter offer?" the Boss asks, as Karl and his entourage lose some of their former enthusiasm.</p><p>"Was it your home addresses?" I ask. "Because I saw him looking them up."</p><p>Karl et al refuse to answer, gather their things up, and go.</p><p>"What was your counter offer?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"I believe it may have had something to do with his medical condition, the brick under the table and how long it has been since his last lager …"</p>
