            <h3>EPISODE 12 </h3>
            <br /><p> So the Boss has quit and we have to replace him.</p><p>I suggested a piece of office furniture might achieve the same purpose – and not eat all the biscuits – but the Director would still like to fill the position. So the PFY and I are looking through a veritable mountain of CVs and cover letters while the Director takes a holiday.</p><p>HR both pushed the boat out and cast the net wide with a job ad so vague that almost anyone could apply for it – and almost everyone has. </p><p>So now we're interviewing for a "Business Manager."</p><p>"This person," I say to the PFY while holding up a cover letter, "believes he's a good fit for the role because he 'knows how to mind his business'."</p><p>"I'll see your business minder and raise you a guy who in his cover letter admitted that he's – AND I QUOTE – 'No Nucular psychologist'," the PFY responds.</p><p>"Shortlist him!" I say.</p><p>Oh, did I mention that with the Director absent, HR have insisted on placing two of their people on the interview committee?</p><p>"What we're looking for, though," I continue, "is a rambler. You know, someone with several stories that could drag an interview out for a couple of hours."</p><p>"There was one person whose CV listed every dog breeding trophy she'd received in 20 years," the PFY says, scrabbling back through the papers in front of him.</p><p>"Yes, yes, THAT'S what I'm talking about!"</p><p>"There's another one that collects biscuit tins?" the PFY suggests.</p><p>"How many have they got?"</p><p>"A couple of thousand."</p><p>"Have they categorized them?"</p><p>>scrabble< "It doesn't say."</p><p>"No problems – we can delve into that at the interview."</p><p>…</p><p>HR aren't happy. Apparently we're supposed to winnow the shortlist to three candidates. However, I manage to negotiate up to five – including a bloke with a cassette tape library of birdcall recordings.</p><p>…</p><p>A few days later the first candidate shows up and we get right into it.</p><p>"What's your favorite processor socket?" the PFY asks, pen poised.</p><p>"Beg pardon?" our interviewee asks, his 12 years in the holistic hemp oil industry not helping him much with that question.</p><p>"Processor socket," I say. "But moving right on – tell me, how many versions of OS/2 were released?"</p><p>"I … would I need to know that?" he asks.</p><p>"No," I respond. "No one does."</p><p>"If you were a cloud hosting platform, which cloud hosting platform would you be?" the PFY asks.</p><p>Our candidate looks at us with a blank expression on his face.</p><p>"Perhaps we could ask some questions that would be directly related to the role?" one of the HR blokes suggests.</p><p>"Sure, sure," I say. "If you woke up in a shallow grave in a forestry setting with a lump on your head, would you tell anyone? Asking for a friend."</p><p>"What?!"</p><p>"Maybe stick to relevant business questions," HR suggests.</p><p>…</p><p>The interviews continue, each applicant being asked for some practical demonstration of their fit for the role. The only standout was the ex-baker who'd come with a pie chart made out of a real pie, representing the areas he thought would be a good fit for the company.</p><p>…</p><p>"Well, it doesn't look promising," one of the HR types sighs when we've seen everyone.</p><p>"No, probably not," I agree, "though it would probably have been a bit better to have advertised this as a technical role."</p><p>"Really? You didn't mention this when we advertised," the other HR droid replies, "or when we changed the job description. As it happens, I think we may have an internal candidate who could be a good fit …"</p><p>And now I see we've fallen for the gold mine gambit – they get the gold and we get the shaft. </p><p>"They'll need to go through the same interview process," I stress.</p><p>"Fine!" HR says, happily.</p><p>…</p><p>"So, tell me about your IT experience?" I ask.</p><p>"I have a reasonable amount of high level IT experience as I was one of the key players before we went to online sales," our candidate says.</p><p>"So you were a salesperson?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"I started in sales but I'm currently the head of the Direct Marketing section."</p><p>"You mean were the head of Direct Marketing?"</p><p>"What?!" our candidate asks, apparently unaware of the reason he was encouraged to apply for this role.</p><p>"Perhaps we could move on with the interview," one of the HR types prompts quickly.</p><p>"It says on your CV that you're a very quick learner, able to pick up practical skills faster than most?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Yes, I've always been able to do that," our candidate nods.</p><p>"As it happens we have a practical test just outside," the PFY says, gesturing him out.</p><p>…</p><p>"This is highly unusual," the HR bloke says as the PFY hands our candidate a unicycle.</p><p>"No, no," the PFY insists. "It's a practical test – as he's a very quick learner."</p><p>"Yes, but …"</p><p>"No, it's OK," our candidate says, mounting the unicycle awkwardly. "I've always liked a challenge …"</p><p>>nudge<</p><p>>squeak<</p><p>>D-d-d-d-d-d-d-dd-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d >crash<</p><p>"I hardly think it was necessary to open the stairwell door," HR notes dryly.</p><p>"Really?" the PFY says. "I think he was doing quite well – and he did say he enjoyed a challenge."</p><p>…</p><p>"So … maybe we get that baker in for a second interview?" I ask.</p>
