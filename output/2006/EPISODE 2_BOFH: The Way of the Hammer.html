It almost went, though. It's probably just not made very robustly."</p><p>"Yes," the PFY adds thoughtfully. "When will motherboard manufacturers realise that so many engineers are skilled in 'The Way of the Hammer' and strengthen their componentry accordingly?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>"After all, the Way of the Hammer is an art passed down from generation to generation."</p><p>"It's not like I INTENDED.."</p><p>"From grandfather to father, from father to uncoordinated son."</p><p>"I hardly think it's..."</p><p>"A time-honoured tradition of the passing on of skills - were your chosen career PANELBEATING or DEBT COLLECTION, BUT IT'S NOT, IS IT - IT'S THE REPAIR OF MICROELECTRONIC CIRCUITS!"</p><p>"Yes, but it only needed to move a fraction of a mil - I've done it dozens of times!"</p><p>"And how many times was it successful?"</p><p>"Every time!" the engineer responds, sounding slightly hurt.</p><p>"I'm talking about the machine being in a working condition at the end - not the hammer surviving!"</p><p>"It's..."</p><p>"...a buggered phone charging machine?" the PFY finishes.</p><p>... One motherboard replacement later ...</p><p>"It's just that these motherboards aren't designed for this particular PCI card - there's no clearance because of the AGP card," the engineer explains as he puts the machine back together and attempts to squeeze the new card in.</p><p>"Why not put it in another slot?" the PFY says wincing at the butchery taking place.</p><p>"There's no slots free."</p><p>"Look, if you moved this card to that slot you could use the vacant slot - with more clearance - for the new card."</p><p>"But then I'd have to remove that card."</p><p>"To make space, yes."</p><p>"But this is just an install job, I can't do modifications - it's not on the work request." he says, flashing his PDA.</p><p>"But now it's a motherboard replacement job, too."</p><p>"Which I've done."</p><p>"So why don't you move the cards around - they were all out anyway."</p><p>"No, I couldn't do that - I'd be liable if something went wrong after the move".</p><p>"What about if I did the move," the PFY snaps testily.</p><p>"If you did the move you'd void the maintenance on the box."</p><p>"But, if I'd done the move before you got here, you'd never have known."</p><p>"But you didn't."</p><p>"What about if, while you were having a cup of coffee, the board suddenly moved."</p><p>"Well you'd void your maintenance."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Because the card had been moved."</p><p>"But no-one would know it'd been moved - it's not like you document the card locations of all the machines you maintain is it?"</p><p>"No, but I would know it had been moved" the engineer responds, in a life-threateningly pedantic manner.</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"I'd remember."</p><p>"Not if you had Alzheimer's."</p><p>"I don't have Alzheimer's!"</p><p>"Well maybe not Alzheimer's, but what about a bang on the head?"</p><p>"I haven't had a >CLANG!< >thud<"</p><p>"You have now... "</p><p>. . . 10 minutes later . . .</p><p>"...and you must have hit your head on the top of the rack when you stood up," the PFY explains to his groggy victim.</p><p>"Oh, really? Right well, nothing broken so I'd best get this card in... .... Wasn't that card in that slot over ther.. >CLANG!< >thud<"</p><p>> BOFH EPISODE COMPILER ERROR, RECURSIVE LOOP DETECTED <</p><p>... >BOFH EPISODE COMPILER ERROR, CLOCK RESET< minutes later ...</p><p>"...so I'd best get this card in. Ah, at least we've got a free slot with some room around it. A lot of the time you have to cram it in against the AGP card which means you sometimes have to give the PCI slot connector a little bit of a tap. And...."</p><p>"And?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Do you ever get... Deja Vu?"</p><p>"No, but we get most of the other Sky channels."</p><p>"Pardon?"</p><p>"Did you say something?" the PFY asks innocently.</p><p>"I... No. Right, well it all seems to be done. Now if you could just sign here as some of the work I did was chargeable."</p><p>">clang< You don't need me to sign there," the PFY says, staring into the engineers eyes intently.</p><p>"I don't need you to sign there."</p><p>"This isn't the job you're supposed to be at."</p><p>"This isn't the job I'm supposed to be at."</p><p>"You can go about your business."</p><p>"I'll go about my business."</p><p>"OK then," the PFY says. "Got all your stuff?"</p><p>"Yes, I've got my tools, got the install software and... What's this motherboard off?"</p><p>"Oh it's a broken one," the PFY says. "One of our other engineers left it."</p><p>"Oh, because it looks like someone tried to move the PCI slot over by ta.. >CLONG!<"</p><p>> BOFH EPISODE COMPILER ERROR, RECURSION REENTERED, EPISODE ABORTING < Â®</p>
