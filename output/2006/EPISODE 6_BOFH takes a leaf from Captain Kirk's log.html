            <h1>BOFH takes a leaf from Captain Kirk's log </h1> 
            <h2>New recruit lost on unexplored planet </h2>
            <h3>EPISODE 6 </h3>
            <br /><p> It's always the new guy that starts the trouble. OK, that's not entirely true - very occasionally it's the sleeper who's been happily working away in the company for years who suddenly gets his activation signal - but mostly it's the new guys.</p><p>"I now know why Kirk always sent the new guy down to visit the unexplored planet," I tell the PFY as I open the latest memo.</p><p>"He didn't always send the new guy," the PFY counters, showing some closet trekkie traits.</p><p>"But when he did, what happened to the new guy?"</p><p>"They usually never came back."</p><p>"That's right. Because Kirk could SPOT A TROUBLEMAKER A MILE AWAY!"</p><p>"Yes" the PFY says both dryly and doubtfully.</p><p>"Ok, pop quiz. There's a new guy in HR with no redundancies to hand out and no pay rises to veto. What's he going to do to make sure that it looks like he's working?"</p><p>"Shuffle papers?"</p><p>"No, that's a dead giveaway. He's bored and looking for a way to ensure his name's at the top of the list come promotion time...."</p><p>"Uh..."</p><p>"There are two common ways to distinguish yourself, either a. by having a fantastic innovative idea which makes the company a better place to work in, or b. taking someone down for some petty violation of a policy that's impossible to implement. And if you can combine both by taking down someone who may have massaged a couple of rules regarding personal disclosure, all the better"</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>I hand the memo over.</p><p>"He wants to see our Data Security Policy document, so what?"</p><p>"Get it for me will you?"</p><p>"Sure, where is it?"</p><p>"And THAT is the problem. If you read on, they also want to see our Disclosure to the Media Policy and Personal Privacy Policy Documents."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"So we haven't got them. And as contractors we're required to have them available to the company."</p><p>"Oh. How come they've never asked before?"</p><p>"Because no one cares. Yes, they care about data security and personal privacy, but they don't want to see a policy documents about them - they'd just like to know that we have a code somewhere which we adhere to."</p><p>"And the new guy knows we don't have them?"</p><p>"Who knows? He might just be good at his job or he could just be a dyed-in-the-hemp privacy loving hippy. We won't know till we go to the meeting."</p><p>"Meeting?"</p><p>"Yes, meeting. "See," I say, tapping my memo. "You got one of these memos too, as did the contract DBA."</p><p>...Later that day...</p><p>"Ok, so I've been looking at your policy documents and just have a few questions," the new HR guy says.</p><p>"Mmm?"</p><p>"For a start, they're all the same."</p><p>"Yes, we agreed to combine our efforts to produce the documents."</p><p>"Two years ago," the DBA adds - as rehearsed.</p><p>"Uh-huh," the HR person comments. "I note that these contracts look a lot like ones available on the internet. In fact, the section on 'Non-disclosure of personal information' happened upon in the course of your work' is word for word the same as found on this website.</p><p>"Really? Great minds must just think alike."</p><p>"Which would mean that you'd be able to answer questions on a section at random?"</p><p>"Uh...not verbatim responses, but the gist of the document, yes."</p><p>"So what about >flip< >flip< Section 4 - Non-Disclosure, subsection B: You observe the actions of an employee which may or may not be part of their work during a period of the day which might be personal time. Under what circumstances would it be permissible to communicate these actions to a fellow employee?"</p><p>"You mean if someone's probably on work time, probably arsing around - and we see it - could we tell their Boss?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"That's one possible interpretation, yes."</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>"No you can't," the HR geek counters.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"You can't communicate it because a. it's potentially their personal time and b. it's potentially unrelated to work. If there's any ambiguity privacy must be maintained."</p><p>"It doesn't say that in our document."</p><p>"Then I suggest you update your document."</p><p>"Ok. >tap< There we go." the PFY says tapping away at his PDA then pointing it at the infrared receiver on the printer in the corner "New revision, coming up."</p><p>>Whirr<</p><p>. . .</p><p>"Yes, that's better" he says. "And one final question - where are the publicly available copies of these documents?"</p><p>"Sorry?" I ask, getting a little testy.</p><p>"As part of your contract you're required to have copies of these document publicly available for perusal by staff. Not doing so - well, that would be a breach of your contract" he smiles evilly.</p><p>...can't...stop...the...voices...</p><p>"No problem," I respond. "They're kept in the documents room in the basement."</p><p>"Really - how's about I go and check on them now?"</p><p>"I...well, it's afternoon tea time - why not?"</p><p>...Later, in the basement..</p><p>>ring< >ring< >ring< >ring< >ring< >ring<</p><p>"Hello?" the HR guy gasps.</p><p>"Hi, I just thought I'd see if you'd located those documents?" I ask.</p><p>"You're for it! There's no documents down here - just an empty filing cabinet and a phone which won't make outgoing calls."</p><p>"Really?" I gasp, going for the shocked reaction.</p><p>"And the door handle on this side of the door is broken!"</p><p>"Really - I'll pop down and let you out. But wait! You've got the only key!"</p><p>"Ring the buildings people."</p><p>"Good idea! But wait! You went down there at afternoon tea time."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"Well that would potentially be your personal time. I... couldn't tell anyone."</p><p>"IT'S NOT MY PERSONAL TIME!!!" the HR geek cries.</p><p>"Yeah...but I'm feeling a bit ambiguous about this..."</p><p>...</p><p>"So how long so we leave him down there before we slip the resignation form under the door?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"I'm thinking almost to the drinking-your-own-urine stage..."</p><p>"This time tomorrow then?"</p><p>"Yeah!"
