            <h3>EPISODE 7 </h3>
            <br /><p> "I'd like a bit of birthday advice," the Boss asks, after the PFY and I show up to his office in response to a call.</p><p>"Keep having them?" the PFY chips.</p><p>"Wa?"</p><p>"Forgive my assistant," I say calmly. "His battery's almost flat and needs a good recharging with a high voltage device. What he meant to say was that we'd prefer cash in large denomination bills."</p><p>"?"</p><p>"Normally it's up to an individual manager's discretion about making some personal contribution on the anniversary of someone's birth."</p><p>"Oh. No, that wasn't what I was after. I wanted to know about digital cameras."</p><p>"I'd still rather have the cash," I confess.</p><p>"No, I want to buy one for the wife - her birthday!!!" he blurts, tapping the photo frame on his desk. "But I don't know what to look for."</p><p>"What do you want the camera for?" I ask.</p><p>"Her birthday."</p><p>"No, what do you want to USE the camera for?"</p><p>"Just holidays, photos of the family. But I don't know what I should be looking for - there's so many options," the Boss burbles, flipping the pages of a digital photography magazine.</p><p>"Well if it's for your family," the PFY responds, suppressing a shudder as he looks at the chamber of horrors that is the Boss' desktop photo. "I'd be looking for a couple of things."</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Low resolution for a start," he continues, taking another gander at the Pandora's family photo.</p><p>"Really? The magazines seem to rate higher resolution as important."</p><p>"Low resolution gives you the benefit of...uh...soft focus - especially if the camera is used at a distance."</p><p>"Oh. What about zoom?"</p><p>"Ordinarily a good thing, but in your case I'd avoid it like the plague. You can use digital zoom later!"</p><p>"But won't my images become... >flip< >flip< >flip< uh...pixilated?"</p><p>"Yes. But pixilation is a good thing - it's even more soft focus."</p><p>"Speaking of focus - fixed focus or auto focus?"</p><p>"I shouldn't worry too much about focus if I were you..."</p><p>"Why not just get a family portrait?" I say tactfully. "They can do wonderful things with an airbrush these days!"</p><p>"What...why?"</p><p>"Well...Just...sometimes it takes a professional to bring out the true photogenic quality."</p><p>"Oh. I SEE!" the Boss snaps. "Well my family may not be the Osbornes..."</p><p>"Donny and Maree, or Ozzy and Sharon?" the PFY asks helpfully.</p><p>"..." the boss says.</p><p>"Don't listen to him," I say, cooling the situation off a little. "How about you just buy something entry level and, if things...work out...you can upgrade to something much better in the future. That way you get a chance to experiment with the medium and see how you like it!"</p><p>"What about digital enhancements?"</p><p>"I think you'd best leave that to the professionals - they get paid to do that to themselves. Those new electronic vacuum devices are not for the uninitiated..."</p><p>"Huh? I was talking about external flash and datestamping."</p><p>"Oh, right! In that case I think you'll find most cameras have datestamping and an internal flash."</p><p>"Yes, but what about an external flash?"</p><p>"Ah...darkness is your friend," the PFY suggests condescendingly.</p><p>"I...should I get more storage?"</p><p>"Nah, cameras are tiny things - you could just put it on the shelf."</p><p>"I meant more internal storage in the camera!"</p><p>"Oh, ok. I dunno, if you use all the soft focus options we've suggested you should get by with the standard 128 MB card."</p><p>"Hmmm. Yes, well, thanks for your help but I think I'll just ask the guy at the shop."</p><p>There's just no helping some people...</p><p>...</p><p>"So what do you think?" the Boss asks, displaying his latest purchases.</p><p>"Nice," the PFY says. "10 megapixel SLR with interchangeable lenses, low light enhancement and up to 1/4000 shutter speed. And you're sure you showed the salesguy your wallet photo? It's such a cruel trick!"</p><p>"What?!"</p><p>"I said it's such a cool thing." the PFY blurts. "It's what I'd get myself if I were looking for a camera. Oooh, and look, a one gig storage card. I like it. Mind if I snap a couple of shots of the office?"</p><p>"I...no, go ahead."</p><p>...The next day...</p><p>"It's going back?!" I gasp as I see the camera all boxed up as new with attached receipt.</p><p>"Yes, I...the wife's decision. She doesn't like it."</p><p>"That's such a shame. She didn't like the features?"</p><p>"No"</p><p>"The cost?"</p><p>"No"</p><p>"The complicated interface?"</p><p>"No, I think it must have been the HUNDRED OR SO PHOTOS OF THE ATTRACTIVE WOMEN THAT WORK HERE!" the Boss snaps.</p><p>"Ah. So the PFY left some images on the card that your wife thought you'd taken?"</p><p>"It would seem so," the Boss seethes.</p><p>"Oh, and as a result you lose your camera?"</p><p>"Oh, not just the camera," the Boss says, as he starts putting his desktop contents into a box.</p><p>"SHE MADE YOU RESIGN!" I gasp. "What a result!"</p><p>"I beg your pardon?"</p><p>"I said, what an insult!"</p><p>...later that day...</p><p>"He QUIT?!" the PFY said "But I actually liked him!"</p><p>"So you sabotaged his camera?"</p><p>"I didn't, I was taking some snaps of the girls. I didn't want him to go!"</p><p>"I think you're going to have to accept some of the blame."</p><p>"I...didn't even mean to!"</p><p>"Sometimes bastardhood's like a magnet - you just can't turn it off."</p><p>"That's terrible" the PFY says. "... ... ... Still, tough luck. Fancy a pint?"</p><p>Ah, the recovery powers of youth. They bounce back so quick... Â®</p>
