            <h2>And that's what happens when you don't listen to your friendly BOFH </h2>
            <h3>EPISODE 6 </h3>
            <br /><p> "So is all the data gone?" the voice whimpers over the hands-free.</p><p>"Did you take a backup like I told you?" I ask.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Then yes, it's all gone," I say. "You either put a backup client on your laptop and back it up to the backup server or connect an external disk and use that - but if you use nothing..."</p><p>"I don't understand how this could happen. The laptop's less than a year old!"</p><p>"Age is no guarantee of reliability. Just look at senior management."</p><p>"Yes, but you only mentioned that I should take a backup two days ago!"</p><p>Call me a little sensitive but I get the feeling that my user is trying to put 2 and 2 together to get 73.</p><p>"What are you suggesting?" I ask.</p><p>"I... nothing."</p><p>"Oh. I thought you might have been suggesting that this was part of the Quantum Law of Negative Event Probabilities."</p><p>"The negative quantum law of what now?"</p><p>"The Quantum Law of Negative Event Probabilities."</p><p>"What's that mean?"</p><p>"It's a simple law which basically states that the moment you talk about something bad happening the likelihood of it happening increases. "</p><p>"So why's that quantum?"</p><p>"Because, like quantum physics, where the act of observing affects the thing being observed, the act of mentioning a bad event affects it's probability."</p><p>"I don't think that's a real thing."</p><p>"How often," I ask, "have you mentioned that you hope it doesn't rain because you left your umbrella at home? And it has subsequently rained?"</p><p>"That's just coincidence!"</p><p>"Really? So how often have you said that you hope that you will find a fifty quid note on the footpath – and it hasn't happened?"</p><p>"Fifty quid notes aren't that common."</p><p>"Okay 20 quid – no, FIVE quid?"</p><p>"That's not the sort of thing I hope for."</p><p>"So instead you're hope that it'll rain or that your hard drive will fail?"</p><p>"I was hoping that my hard drive wouldn't fail."</p><p>"THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU BACK IT UP WHEN I TOLD YOU TO?!"</p><p>"I didn't think it was that important."</p><p>"I told you it was making clicking noises and was on the way out!"</p><p>"Yes, but you didn't say SOON."</p><p>"And you obviously hadn't heard of the Quantum Law of Negative Event Probabilities at that stage."</p><p>"You're just making that up!"</p><p>"I could think of three things, RIGHT NOW, which would happen if I said them – within the next three days."</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>"Okay. 1. I hope your printer doesn't run out of toner."</p><p>"Printers always run out of toner."</p><p>"Let me finish! Run out of toner AND STOP. Not just stop waiting for Toner, but stop dead and require an engineer."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"2. I hope the wireless network doesn't let people associate but not get to the internet."</p><p>"That happened last year!"</p><p>"Yes, but I've said it now so it'll happen in the next three days.
3. I hope that the Boss doesn't come through the door and complain about some bloody user who claims we've insulted, assaulted, or pepper-and-salted them."</p><p>"Pepper-and-salted?"</p><p>"I couldn't think of a third thing. But you get the picture."</p><p>"Yes. Well. I..."</p><p>"Hmmm?" I challenge</p><p>"Well, from all I've heard, I rather thought one of the things was going to be a threat about ... uh.. me.. having an accident."</p><p>"Now why would you say that?"</p><p>"Well, I mean I've heard the stories."</p><p>"No, I mean why would you say that after I've just explained the Quantum Law of Negative Event Probabilities."</p><p>"... oh."</p><p>"But I'm going to pretend that I didn't hear anything – because if you're not careful you will trigger the Exponential Quantum Law of Negative Event Probabilities."</p><p>"The Exponential Law? What's that?"</p><p>"That's where my assistant overhears something negative that someone says and makes it so. For 5 quid. He has a very low bar."</p><p>"I don't know what that means."</p><p>"He will do most bad things for a fiver. It's probably index-linked to the price of a pint at his favourite drinker."</p><p>"Where the hell is he buying his beer?"</p><p>"That is irrelevant. Where's just trying to keep you on the safe side of the Law - because if I mentioned within his hearing that I hoped that, for instance, you didn't get punched in the face for not backing up your hard drive it would almost certainly occur."</p><p>"But you're not going to do that."</p><p>"No, because if I did the chances of it occurring within the next three days would be exponentially higher with every day that passed. In fact exponentially higher with every MINUTE that passes."</p><p>"I hardly think you can apply that >CLATTER<"</p><p>...two minutes later...</p><p>"That's 15 quid you owe me," the PFY says, laying half a mutilated toner cartridge and a wireless access point patch lead on the table and rubbing his knuckles.</p><p>"Make that 20," he adds moments later as the Boss stalks in to Mission Control. "Did I mention how good that cellphone baby monitor app is?" ®</p>
