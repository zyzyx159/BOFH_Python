            <br /><p></p><p>"OK, let's just take a look then," our recent office addition says, clicking on the network management tool.</p><p>"Ah, there's your problem - your port is only set to 10 megabits per second, half duplex. If I just change that to auto you'll notice a short outage while your machine's network interface readjusts itself to 100 meg full duplex and then everything will be working tickety-boo for you.. No, No, don't mention it - and have a really great day."</p><p>. . .</p><p>"Did you know that all the data ports on that switch are hard configured to 10meg half duplex?" Graham the temp asks.</p><p>"Yeah," the PFY says, feigning interest. "It's probably something the previous admins did."</p><p>"But didn't you install those switches?"</p><p>"Yes - from the old building - but we didn't configure them."</p><p>"Really? You didn't take the changeover as an opportunity to revise the configs?"</p><p>"Not at the time, no," the PFY says, never one to seek out work unnecessarily - a stickler for the adage 'if it isn't broken, who gives a crap'.</p><p>I live my life by that.</p><p>"So these are configured the same way as they were..."</p><p>"In 1997, yes."</p><p>"You don't have a switch replacement policy?"</p><p>"Of course we do," I say. "If it's on fire it can go on next year’s replacement schedule!"</p><p>"But what happens meantime?”</p><p>“Oh, we’ve got a cupboard full of 10 meg PoE hubs that are still working perfectly!” the PFY says. “Which is why we don’t like to set the switch speed too high - they might notice.”</p><p>“You mean PoE switches?”</p><p>“No I mean PoE hubs. I tell you, they are as rare as rocking horse shit,” the PFY says. “But we’ve got stacks of them!”</p><p>“So there’s no QoS on them then?”</p><p>“No chance.”</p><p>“Doesn’t it affect the VOIP phones?”</p><p>“You’d think so wouldn’t you - but what we do is when we install a hub we slap it on a VLAN which has all the non-voice services deprioritised.”</p><p>“But doesn’t that make the servers and internet appear slow?”</p><p>“It sort of does, but with the desktops configured the way they are...”</p><p>>ring<</p><p>“Hello, Graham here, how can I help?”</p><p>“It’s still as bad as it was before. Would you hold please? >tappity< Yes, well it looks like your machine is requesting 10 meg half du.. can I get back to you? Thanks >click< You’ve set everyone’s desktop machines to 10 meg half duplex?!”</p><p>“Bingo,” the PFY says.</p><p>“And if he had his way,” I say, gesturing at the PFY, “We’d have upgraded to coax.”</p><p>”But you’ve got high spec copper to the desktop.”</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>“And multi-gigabit core and distribution network hardware.”</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>“But prehistoric access switches???”</p><p>“Indeed,” the PFY says. “Back in the day some beancounter configured a cable warranty period as an active switch hardware lifetime figure in the asset depreciation schedule. Those ancient 100 meg switches are all about halfway through their book-rated lives.”</p><p>“Now we’ve done what we could about this,” I add. “My assistant here managed to back a van over a couple of boxes of them during the building move - which was quite tricky as they were being carried by the movers at the time - but we have stacks of them to replace.”</p><p>“So in the meantime you just... manage expectations?” Graham asks, seeing a glimmer of the light.</p><p>“Manage user expectations and actively assist in switch failure,” the PFY counters.</p><p>“By assisting you mean?”</p><p>“We mean backing the cage nut screws on the switch off so far that the slightest touch (by a beancounter wondering why his port speed is 10meg half duplex) will cause the switch to fall from its lofty perch.”</p><p>“Onto the floor,” Graham nods.</p><p>“No,” the PFY says, “onto the switch below it - with the loose cage nut screws - which falls onto the switch below it - with the loose cage screws - and so on and so on until all the switches fall...”</p><p>“Onto the floor,” Graham nods.</p><p>“No,” the PFY says. “onto the beancounter. Because after all, they started it.”</p><p>“I see,” Graham says. “And so I’ve pretty much put a spanner in the works.”</p><p>“Not entirely,” the PFY says. “Just ring the beancounter back and tell him it’s all working perfectly.”</p><p>“But won’t he...”</p><p>“Think you’re lying? Of course he will. Then he’ll get the key that he thinks we don’t know he has and just check the comms room for himself...”</p><p>“Several crashes and a small cry later we’ll have an insurance claim ready to be processed,” the PFY finishes.</p><p>“I see. But isn’t it a bit... cruel?”</p><p>“You only say that because you’ve never seen a cupboard full of aging 12-port 100 meg access switches wheezing away,” I say, gesturing at the access comms room. “Just take a look for yourself and see what we mean.”</p><p>. . .</p><p>“I see,” Graham says, as the warm cloud of heated components envelops him. “These things are ancie-"</p><p>>CRASH< >CRASH< >CRASH< >CRASH< >CRASH< >CRASH< >aggg<”</p><p>“Two in one day!” I say, shaking my head.</p><p>“Two?” the PFY asks.</p><p>“Well we’re ringing that beancounter back, aren’t we?”</p>
