            <h3>EPISODE 1 </h3>
            <br /><p></p><p>"It's a Christmas miracle!" the PFY gasps, opening the safe door after our extended Christmas break to find... nothing.</p><p>"Hardly," I say, reaching down to the floor of the safe to retrieve a business card from amongst the coins and cards than no doubt fell out of the Boss's wallet. "Secure Safe Services. Protected Storage experts. 24 Hr on call."</p><p>"He had someone in to open the door!" the PFY swoons.</p><p>"Yes they did," our Boss snaps from the doorway behind us. "I managed to reach Directory Enquiries and get an answer before my cellphone battery died – and even more unbelievably the first person I called was willing to come out to sort the problem out. And I think you know what this means..."</p><p>"I won't be needing the roll of carpet, the company van and half a can of odour neutralising air freshener?" the PFY queries.</p><p>"No..."</p><p>"That the tape safe isn't airtight like the manufacturer claimed?" I ask. "Nor does it block radio signals."</p><p>"Yes... But no."</p><p>"What then?"</p><p>"You're for the high jump!" the Boss snaps. "That's attempted murder!"</p><p>"What is?" I ask</p><p>"Trying to lock me in the safe over the holidays!"</p><p>"Nonsense!" the PFY says. "You shut yourself in the safe after having heaps of lagers and sending out that email about playing hide-and-seek on the last day."</p><p>"What email?"</p><p>"Trust me," the PFY says. "In no time at all there'll be email messages from you to the IT staff about a hide-and-seek marathon on the last day."</p><p>"And if you're not careful there'll be emails from you to the HR staff about a hide-the-sausage marathon on the last day as well!" I add.</p><p>"People would have said something!” the boss snaps back.</p><p>"Not if they didn't know they'd got a message. Like if it's sitting in their Junk Email folder. Until they get a message from the systems people asking them to check it for messages 'that might have got misdelivered over the break'.”</p><p>"There's no proof!"</p><p>"Not yet - but then we're not talking court-of-law here, we're talking court-of-public-opinion. In a court of law they're looking for proof that you definitely did something, whereas in the court-of-public-opinion they're just looking for a hint that you might have done something – to fuel the rumour of you being a perverted sleaze with a fetish for enclosed spaces..."</p><p>"There's no proof I sent the messages, though."</p><p>"Oh you mean like computer forensics?" I say. "Then you haven't seen the PFY's tools for tampering with timestamps and injecting questionable phrases and image data into unallocated regions of a hard drive. Not to mention the one for manipulating the Exchange server to insert messages at certain times – from target machines. They're works of art. Honestly, as 'evidence generation' goes it's so compelling you'll be wondering yourself if you don't have some hidden tendencies that need a bit of over-voltage to sort out.."</p><p>"So... what are you proposing?"</p><p>“I'm proposing we put all these 'misunderstandings' behind us and start the year with a clean slate. We forget all that happened last year and start afresh this year."</p><p>"I... suppose so," the Boss concedes.</p><p>“And so I assume that you'll have to make some revisions to the statement that you no doubt made to security at the end of last year?”</p><p>“I... Yes.”</p><p>“Something along the lines of a terrible misunderstanding when you were feeling a little tired and emotional and that you're really sorry if you made any unfounded allegations out of jealousy and spite.”</p><p>“I... OK.”</p><p>“Now, perhaps?” I say, picking up the phone receiver and handing it to him</p><p>Five minutes later the call is made. With a little bit of help from the PFY and myself the Boss manages to concoct a story to appeal to Security's neadertal intellect (ie an EastEnders episode) about a cocktail of fear, jealousy and high alcohol lager forcing him to make some rash statements that now, in the light of day, he regrets.</p><p>“So that's it then?” the Boss says. “No fake email messages?”</p><p>“Scout's honour. In fact, I'm feeling so good about it, I won't even keep all the crap you dropped in the bottom of the tape safe last year.”</p><p>“Ah yes, that. I'd better get it as it has my gym membersh... >nudge< >SLAM<</p><p>“I thought you said start the year with a clean slate?” the PFY asks.</p><p>“The year started two weeks ago. Now gimme a hand wrapping the safe in tinfoil before Directory Enquiries can answer...”</p>
