            <h3>EPISODE 6 </h3>
            <br /><p></p><p>It’s Mission Control late one morning and we’re giving the Boss a damn good listening to...</p><p>“...and I’ve been talking to Jim from P.R and he says that we can probably do a little better on our machine maintenance because when he was working in a former company he managed to get a 48 per cent reduction in price by presenting vendors with competitive quotes from an alternate service agent.”</p><p>“Yeeees,” I say. “While it is true that reduction in costs is a definite possibility, when looking at such a large reduction in costs we have to bear in mind a few salient points.”</p><p>“Which are?” the Boss asks, listening attentively.</p><p>“Firstly, Jim was probably talking about reduction in the costs of the machinery he was in charge of in his former role – which was, in this case, probably photocopiers and automatic staplers...”</p><p>“And second?”</p><p>“In computing one vendor is unlikely to be able to economically source the spares of another, and...”</p><p>“And..?”</p><p>“And Jim couldn't tell the truth if you paid him to.”</p><p>“Weeellll, I think that’s a little harsh,” the Boss says, shaking his head in a sign of mild disbelief.</p><p>“It’s true!” the PFY gasps. “And he knows bloody EVERYTHING! If your server reboots because a chunk of memory has crapped itself, he’ll be telling you how it’ll be a seating fault, how memory seating is an art unto itself and that he learnt how to seat memory properly from Michael Dell himself.”</p><p>“At Michael's home, over a few beers,” I add. “Because that’s the other thing about Jim. Whatever you do, he’s done something better!”</p><p>“Three times better,” the PFY chips in. “For instance, say you said you had an exciting drive into work this morning.”</p><p>“Jim would say that was nothing,” I comment, “as he used to Rally drive.”</p><p>“In ‘Nam,” the PFY adds.</p><p>“For the V.C,” I offer.</p><p>“In a car with a jet engine.”</p><p>“Powered by a fuel he created from his own urine,” I finish.</p><p>“So you’re suggesting...” the Boss asks</p><p>“He’s a bullshit artist, yes,” the PFY concludes. “And one topic that he believes he qualifies for ‘world authority status’ on is computing.”</p><p>“It can't be that bad,” the Boss says. “He'll just be a user with more experience than most.”</p><p>“Less experience than most is probably more accurate,” I reply. “But that doesn’t stop him from professing his expertise to anyone who listens. But don’t take our word for it, bring up a topic, any topic at all. Religion, say!”</p><p>“Because he met the Pope,” the PFY says.</p><p>“And the Dali Lama.”</p><p>“Sadly he missed out on meeting Mohammed, but he has read all the books and went on a spiritual quest to find the source of the prophet’s teachings.”</p><p>“Before he was made a grand potato of the Kabbalah.”</p><p>“And he’s not one to let complete ignorance of a topic stop him from having an opinion.”</p><p>"Oh..." the Boss says worriedly.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Well, I thought you might appreciate the input... I invited him up."</p><p>"PREMO!" the PFY snaps dryly.</p><p>Moments later Jim arrives and proceeds to tell us how the viewing window in our door is a security risk.</p><p>"It's bullet-proof glass an inch thick!" the PFY lies.</p><p>"I know, but it's still a security risk. Because of ricochets," Jim snaps back.</p><p>"Good point," the boss blathers, picking up a pen and paper and making a note.</p><p>"Anything else?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"The door to your computer room has wire-strengthened glass."</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"It's not bullet-proof though," Jim says smugly.</p><p>"Yes - we wanted to avoid the ricochet risk," the PFY chirps sarcastically. "Anything more?"</p><p>"Is that an open riser?" he asks, pointing through the viewing window on the computer room door.</p><p>"Indeed," the PFY says, leading us into the computer room and to the riser door. "But as you can see, it's behind two secure doors and has this >clank< steel bar to stop people entering, this steel tray >bonga< >bonga< to stop people falling if they do enter and this video camera..."</p><p>"To let you know if someone enters the riser," Jim finishes.</p><p>"No, that's just so we can send something into those 'most hilarious deaths' TV shows. We've had some close calls..."</p><p>"You've had some close calls!" Jim gasps. "I was working on an oil rig in the north sea one time and the drill crane pulley broke and so I had to climb the boom and... "</p><p>>clank< >bonga< >Crash< >crash< >crash< >clunk< >thud<</p><p>"Do you want to say it or should we?" the PFY says. "Still plenty of room down there..."</p><p>"I... uh... t-t-there's been a terrible accident??"</p><p>"BINGO!"</p>
