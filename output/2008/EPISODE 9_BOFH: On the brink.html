            <br /><p></p><p>“You don’t have to do this,” I say calmly to the PFY as the wind and rain washes and whistles around us on the roof of the building.</p><p>“I do!” the PFY says. “I have to!”</p><p>“You don’t – it’s not... necessary” I say.</p><p>“It IS!” the PFY counters urgently. “I must!”</p><p>“Let's just think about this clearly,” I say, speaking quietly so the PFY has to lean back from the edge of the building to hear me.</p><p>“I have,” the PFY whimpers. “I have thought about it carefully. It’s the only way!”</p><p>“It’s not the only way,” I proffer. “There’s other ways. It doesn’t have to be the end.”</p><p>“It MUST!” the PFY shouts. “I can’t go on like this!”</p><p>“You just have to be strong,” I say, trying to reason with him now.</p><p>“I’m not strong,” the PFY sighs. “I can’t do it!”</p><p>“Of course you can,” I say, reaching out my hand towards him in a gesture of understanding. “Now... hand over the SCO install disks.”</p><p>“I CAN’T!” the PFY squeals. “I can’t bear the thought of installing it again. It was bad enough when I didn’t know better, but now it’s just too horrible.”</p><p>“Think of the children!” I gasp, as the PFY’s hand again moves over the edge.</p><p>“What bloody children?”</p><p>“The children on the streets below. What if a child found those CDs? They might take it home, boot their machine off them and think that sort of thing is... normal, good even.”</p><p>“No!” the PFY gasps. “Not even a child is that stupid!”</p><p>“But you can’t be sure, can you?” I say. “It might happen. Just hand the disks over and it’ll all be ok.”</p><p>“How do I know I can trust you?” the PFY whimpers again.</p><p>“Because I’m a professional,” I say “Because we’ve worked together for years. Because we have mutual respect. And because there’s a SWAT guy climbing up the ledge behind you.”</p><p>“Wha..” the PFY says as I quickly slip the cattleprod onto his neck...</p><p>. . . Three days later in a room that doesn’t officially exist . . .</p><p>“Well, it’s the real thing,” says a white-coated bloke carrying a CD Caddy with a large lock on it. “The full SCO install media with all the maintenance packs probably has a street value of... next to nothing.”</p><p>“So it’s the latest version then?” I say.</p><p>“Oh yes. What I can’t understand is how he managed to get his hands on it - I mean in this country we have very strict import legislation which is supposed to cover indecent, objectionable and just plain crap material.”</p><p>“Careful – you’ll affect the Spice Girls comeback with talk like that!” I caution. “Has my assistant come round yet?”</p><p>“Oh yes, he’s up and about,” labcoat says, pressing a button which turns the wall into a viewing window of the PFY wandering blearily around a white room. “We initially had him under sedation, but once we realised he’d actually booted off the media we thought it prudent to induce an artificial coma for a couple of days.”</p><p>“You made him read the Richard Stallman story?”</p><p>“Yeah – though he only got as far as the foreword.”</p><p>“Really?” I say “I can only remember the dedication.”</p><p>“I know - most people do. They say the typesetter was on adrenalin and speed for his own safety. After the first three deaths leastways.”</p><p>“So he’s free to go?” I say, pointing at the PFY.</p><p>“Sure,” labcoat says, pressing a button to open the back door in the PFY’s room which now exits onto a Soho side street. “He’ll find his own way home but will have no memory of the last few days - he'll think he’s been out on a vendor-bender.”</p><p>“And what do I tell his girlfriend?”</p><p>“Just tell her you think he caught a 72-hour virus,” labcoat says. “And that he needs to be kept on a diet of meat, veg and Blackadder reruns.”</p><p>“And he’ll be ok?”</p><p>“Hopefully. Most people make a full recovery though some have relapses – he’s certainly not the worst we’ve seen. We had one guy in here who’d accidentally bought the full OS2 Warp install media on eBay thinking it was a Star Trek movie. Now he was hard work because it was both crap and ancient. We made him read Stallman four times before he was able to be released.”</p><p>“Ah, D...” another labcoat says walking in. “Speaking of that Warp install media, you haven’t seen it have you?”</p><p>“No, why, when did you last have it?”</p><p>“Uh... Not sure. I know I had it in my pocket when we brought that last guy around...”</p><p>. . .</p><p>I could go on about Tranquiliser guns in Soho but the D-Notices are fairly specific...</p>
