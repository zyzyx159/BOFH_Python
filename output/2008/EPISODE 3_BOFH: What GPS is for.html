            <h3>EPISODE 3 </h3>
            <br /><p></p><p>The good thing about sales reps is that they're never too busy to come on site and explain a couple of their products to you if there's a potential sale in it. Better still when the IT consumables company replaces the grizzled veteran of "over a million 8 inch floppies sold" with Susan, a lovely young woman with a pleasant nature and the drinking habits of a CAMRA founding member...</p><p>So I'm ordering my second gross of cleaning tapes over a couple of quiet pints at the pub when the Boss trundles in with a sneaky expression on his face to interrupt my important work-related chatting up...</p><p>"Uhh... where's your offsider at the moment?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"Who?" I ask whilst giving the thumbs up to a third carton of cleaning tapes (which will probably be sufficient to see the company through to the next millennium).</p><p>"Your assistant."</p><p>"Oh him. He's probably still offsite doing those VPN client installs you asked for."</p><p>"How far's he got?"</p><p>"No idea," I say. "But at about 20 minutes a time plus half an hour travel he's probably almost done by now."</p><p>"So you don't know exactly?" he asks - attempting to make some sort of point. "What if you needed him to help you with something?"</p><p>"I'd ring him on his mobile," I suggest.</p><p>"What if he's had an accident?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"Then he's not going to be any help to me is he?"</p><p>"The point I'm trying to make is he should have a GPS on him – or at least the company vehicle should."</p><p>"You mean a GPS tracker," I say.</p><p>"They're... not the same thing?"</p><p>"One is used to help you find where you are, the other’s used to find where something else - like a company car – is."</p><p>"Oh, well I suppose in that case we should just have GPS units then."</p><p>"But what if the PFY's had an accident?" I ask.</p><p>"Like you say - he'd be no help," the Boss says, moving on. "So when can you get a GPS unit - a portable one?"</p><p>"We can do you one of those," Susan chips in, downing her pint of cider and flipping over a couple of pages. "A couple of hundred quid'll get you this one which has an SD card slot and a downloadable range of nav voices - from Spock to Billy Graham."</p><p>"I'll take it!" the Boss gasps. "Simon’ll fix you up with a purchase order..."</p><p>. . .</p><p>"What was that about?" the PFY asks, once the Boss has trundled off.</p><p>"No idea," I said. "He set a speed record in changing from caring about your welfare to not giving a rat’s..."</p><p>"It'll be Geocaching," Susan responds helpfully.</p><p>"Geocaching?"</p><p>"Yeah, it was mentioned in one of those Management rags a couple of weeks back. It's all the rage as middle managers from all over the place are ordering top-of-the-line GPS units as IT gear. I've sold out of all the top line models already."</p><p>"But why’s the Boss spending my budget on toys?"</p><p>"It's happening all over the place. The rag has their own geocaching page where employers can leave clues and coordinates for readers to pick up hints on job prospects – the theory being that if you’re good enough to solve the clues you might be a good prospect for employment."</p><p>"And this is popular?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Oh yeah!" Susan responds. "We lost one of our people to a company just down the road! They just gave the salary, the GPS coordinates and a simple substitution code clue!"</p><p>"And he was gone?"</p><p>"Yep. He found the place in his lunch hour and was gone."</p><p>"Curiouser and curiouser..." the PFY says thoughtfully. "You wouldn’t know the name of the website would you?"</p><p>. . .</p><p>A few days later the Boss returns from lunch nursing a black eye, a bloody nose and a broken GPS, so we know the dream’s over...</p><p>"What happened?" I ask feigning concern.</p><p>"I... tripped," he says. "But I really need to organise a new GPS as the screen on this one’s broken and I have something I need to look up."</p><p>"Staring at the screen when you should have been watching where you were going?" the PFY asks, pulling a replacement unit out of his drawer.</p><p>"Something like that," the Boss says, leaving the broken GPS and wandering off with its replacement.</p><p>"Great stuff this Geocaching," the PFY says, pulling yet another unit out of his drawer. "You find the coordinates of some local night-shift working nutcase, post them - along with some clues that only the Boss could figure out – to the website then pay some kids to ring the nutcase’s doorbell every half hour or so for the next few days before running off... bloody fantastic!"</p><p>That’s technology for you – we’re always finding new uses for it!</p>
