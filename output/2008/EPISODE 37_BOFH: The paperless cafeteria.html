            <br /><p></p><p>"How's that paperless office coming along then?" the Boss asks enthusiastically as he enters Mission Control on his daily constitutional.</p><p>"Paperless office?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Yes, you were saying the other day that we should go to paperless."</p><p>"No I was saying how our printing and copying contract was extortionate," the PFY responds. "And anyway, that's all sorted out now."</p><p>"Ah! Well. I kind of mentioned the paperless office idea to a couple of people and they're quite keen."</p><p>"Are they?" I ask.</p><p>"Well if we're talking paperless, check this out," the PFY says, pointing to a web page on his screen.</p><p>"What am I looking at?" The Boss asks.</p><p>"It's the website that the caterers use for our meals."</p><p>"Really? So they use real ingredients and not just tramp vomit?" I ask.</p><p>"Yeah," the PFY says. "They subscribe to this site, which tells you what meals to prepare for what tier of punter. You choose a week of meals and it orders all the ingredients to be delivered for the food you selected."</p><p>"Tiers?" I ask.</p><p>"Yeah. You have the Platinum range, which is CEO material - escargot and all that, Gold, which is the sort of stuff you'd see at a posh catered event, Silver class, which is nice catered food, down through the various other tiers, to us."</p><p>"What's our tier?" I ask.</p><p>"Uh... it doesn't actually have a name."</p><p>"If we're talking Platinum, Gold and Silver then we're probably around Lead?" I ask.</p><p>"As in poisoning," the PFY adds.</p><p>"Indeed," I say. "But that's probably because 'Transuranic heavy metals may not be used where there is life'"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Nothing, just a quote from the past."</p><p>"Well?"</p><p>...</p><p>"Sapphire's not an element!" the PFY cries a few minutes later, poking a rather nasty hole in TV history.</p><p>"It hardly matters," The boss interjects. "So this is just a food ordering website saving the hassle of filling out a couple of forms. Surely there's not much paper saving in that?"</p><p>"It's more than that," the PFY says. "Each day the caterers go to the website and see the recipe along with pictures and a little video showing how to make it."</p><p>"And?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"And they don't print any of it. Though it does look like the web server is particularly poorly protected," the PFY hints.</p><p>"Meaning?"</p><p>"Someone could go into the website, make some fairly minor modifications to the recipe and end up with rather nice meat balls instead of the Hungarian glue-lash that they manage to make out of most things."</p><p>"But then you'd need to make a video and have pictures," I counter.</p><p>"Yes, that's where it comes unstuck - you'd only really get away with some minor quantity changes. However, that said, you could just change options on the webpage..."</p><p>"You mean like.. change the tier of meals we're getting?" the Boss asks furtively.</p><p>"Exactly!" the PFY responds. "You could change the tier you want for this week's meals - and they might put it down to a keyboard error if the finance people complained about the end of month bill."</p><p>"So we could get..." the Boss says.</p><p>"Chicken korma, Peshawari naan and all the poppadoms you could eat? Yes," the PFY responds.</p><p>"But surely it's password protected?"</p><p>"Two minutes with a keypress recorder." the PFY says, holding up a sheet of paper with "CH3F" written on it.</p><p>"But surely the cafeteria people would know?"</p><p>"That's the great thing! The whole site's put together by some publicity seeking pot basher who's promoting new era meals - so the cafeteria staff never know what they'll be cooking from one day to the next.'</p><p>"I... Let's try it with tomorrow's meals," the Boss mumbles. "Just to see."</p><p>"Okay, I'll just pick something in the silver range," the PFY says. "And the best thing about this >clickety< >tap< Is it's completely >click< paperless, meaning..."</p><p>"No audit trail!" I blurt.</p><p>. . . Lunch time the next day . . .</p><p>"This is amazing!" the Boss says, shoveling down a prawn malibari.</p><p>"True," I respond. "People are racing back for seconds instead of to the toilets!"</p><p>"We won't get away with it of course," he replies, the voice of reason intruding. "Finance is bound to find out any day."</p><p>"Yep. But maybe for a couple more days..."</p><p>"So perhaps you should... uh... pull out all the stops?" he hints.</p><p>"You mean... Platinum, all the mods?"</p><p>"Go for it!"</p><p>. . . The next day . . .</p><p>"You're not having any?" the Boss blurts, halfway through his second Fisherman's basket.</p><p>"No," the PFY says. "I had assumed that Platinum would be somewhat better than deep fried seafood and chips."</p><p>"Smothered in tartare sauce," the Boss responds. "It's bloody lovely - so light. A bit salty, but lovely. The staff are loving it."</p><p>. . .</p><p>"So," I ask the PFY moments later. "When are you going to tell him about your recipe update to deep fry them in castor oil?"</p><p>"A couple of minutes after I've visited all the toilets in the building."</p><p>"Ah," I say. "So you're committed to the paperless office thing then?"</p><p>"Oh yes!"</p>
