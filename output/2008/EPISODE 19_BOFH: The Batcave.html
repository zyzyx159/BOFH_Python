            <br /><p></p><p>"You know," I say to the PFY as I pore over some building plans. "I don't think the beancounters are as big a set of idiots as we've given them credit for."</p><p>"How's that then?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"This building they've bought - I've done some admittedly rough sums based around the floor space and previous sales in the area, and I think we may have got a real bargain!"</p><p>"Really?" the PFY says dubiously. "But what does it have to recommend it?"</p><p>"There are seven pubs and two Indian joints within a one block radius, a tube station a couple of blocks away and a women's fitness centre across the road."</p><p>"Oh," the PFY says. "What about the building?"</p><p>"It's an old government department building - from the days when they were all self-contained."</p><p>"Meaning?"</p><p>"Meaning this place had a vehicle workshop, a huge store, cafeteria, plant rooms, the works!"</p><p>"So where's the server room going?"</p><p>"There's two options - the one that the architects have selected, taking into account the needs of insulation, access to services and security..."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"And the place we’re going to go - immediately above the vehicle service bays - taking into account the proximity to pubs/curry houses and that Mission Control would then overlook the fitness place."</p><p>"But why above the service bays?"</p><p>"We could install all our plants in the service bays as opposed to the computer suite and just duct everything up."</p><p>"Doesn't seem to be much of a gain to me..."</p><p>"We could section off another part of the bays and use it for tape safes."</p><p>"Yes, but it d-"</p><p>"We could cut off another chunk and keep all our spares in it."</p><p>"Still..."</p><p>"WE COULD CUT A HOLE IN THE FLOOR OF MISSION CONTROL, INSTALL A POLE, KEEP A CAR IN THE SERVICE BAYS AND CALL IT THE BATMOBILE!"</p><p>"Now you're talking!" the PFY says enthusiastically. "But we’d need to have electric doors with fake windows painted on them. Or trees! Yes, a real batcave! But won't we have a bit of trouble changing the architect's minds?"</p><p>"Nah, we just use some airy-fairy palaver about that location being ideal for input into building heating, carbon neutral, etc. They eat that sort of thing up."</p><p>“You lost me.”</p><p>“Well, with the push for being carbon neutral we just say that we’ll use the heat from the computer room to heat the building.”</p><p>“And in summer?”</p><p>“We use it to heat the pool.”</p><p>“What pool?”</p><p>“The one in the women’s fitness centre. Obviously there’ll need to be the odd bit of maintenance work...”</p><p>. . .</p><p>“You can’t go there,” the Director says.</p><p>“Are you sure?” the PFY asks, waving the ‘insulation tester’ around.</p><p>“It’s not me!” he snivels. “Security want it for their main office, stores want it for the main store and the accountants want it for storing our paper records.”</p><p>. . . One large building fire later . . .</p><p>“Someone’s going to have to pay for this,” the head beancounter sniffs as the fire brigade hose a stack of ashen paper out of one of the basement storerooms.</p><p>“And so they should!” the PFY says. “Who was it said we should only do the mandatory servicing on our fire and intrusion alarms?”</p><p>. . .</p><p>“So it’s just you, security and stores then?” the director asks later in the day. “And I take it there will be no more suspicious fires?”</p><p>“You have to be joking – no, this has to be settled amicably between colleagues. The PFY will see how they’d like to do it.”</p><p>. . .</p><p>“So it’s a game of darts then?” the PFY says to the stores and security managers.</p><p>“Uh-huh,” they respond in unison. “Cider darts!”</p><p>. . .</p><p>“You’re really going to play darts for your rooms?” the Boss asks.</p><p>“Cider darts,” the PFY corrects.</p><p>“What’s that then?”</p><p>“A pint of cider to start,” the security manager says, trundling over under the weight of a pile of lunchtime kebabs. “A pint of cider per round, a pint of cider if a dart misses the board or bounces back onto the floor. A pint of cider to finish.”</p><p>“Catch it with your foot?” the PFY asks.</p><p>“If you catch a bounced dart with your foot before it hits the floor, you can replay it without forfeit,” the stores manager nods.</p><p>“Injury time?”</p><p>“Forfeit the game.”</p><p>“Are you sure you want to do this?” the Boss whispers to me, moments later. “They look like they’re pretty good.”</p><p>“They should be – they’ve both got pub teams, and one of the stores guys brews his own cider.”</p><p>“You don’t stand a chance!” the Boss gasps.</p><p>“’Least we’re having a go though!” I say, as the PFY wanders off to set up the board and grab a couple of dozen boxes of pikey mouthwash.</p><p>. . . The next day . . .</p><p>“How did it go?” the Boss asks.</p><p>“Mint!” the PFY says. “Touch and go for a while, but in the end we won by forfeit.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“Foot injuries from trying to catch a bounced dart.”</p><p>“Both teams?!”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>“Don’t they both wear steel caps?”</p><p>“They do, but a steel cap boot is a poor protection from a dart body made out of a rare earth magnet, expelled from the board by a toned down pinch...” the PFY continues.</p><p>“I...” the Boss says, after we explain the basic concepts. “And so you won?”</p><p>“Well after the PFY had nailed one of the stores guy’s feet to one of the security guy’s feet to the wall behind them it was a bit of a non-event.”</p><p>“And there’ll be no... repercussions?”</p><p>“Nah, we let them keep the cider!”</p>
