            <br /><p></p><p>"Woah!" the PFY breathes, looking up quickly.</p><p>"Woah what?" the Boss asks, looking around cautiously, as I re-enter the room from the passage to the server room.</p><p>"Nope, it'll be OK," I say to the PFY, ignoring the Boss for a moment.</p><p>"What'll be OK?"</p><p>"Are you sure?" the PFY asks. "It was quite noticeable."</p><p>"What was noticeable?"</p><p>"Yeah, but it was quick. Ten quid says it'll be fine."</p><p>"WHAT WILL BE FINE?!"</p><p>"I'll take that bet!" the PFY cries, before turning to the Boss. "We're talking about that power glitch."</p><p>"What power glitch?"</p><p>"The one a couple of moments ago."</p><p>"When?"</p><p>"When the lights dimmed briefly."</p><p>"The lights didn't dim!"</p><p>"They did," I counter.</p><p>"They most certainly did not!"</p><p>"I beg to differ," the PFY snaps with a measure of self-satisfaction. "Behold!"</p><p>Following the PFY's finger I note a couple of red icons where green switches should be.</p><p>Bugger. That's a tenner down the gurgler.</p><p>"I didn't see any power glitch!" the Boss says.</p><p>"You wouldn't," I say. "You've either got it or you don't... and you don't."</p><p>"Got what?"</p><p>"The admin gene," the PFY explains. "The ability to recognise things that users don't. A slight flicker of lighting, a whiff of hot component in the air, a fractional change in the pitch of a cooling fan - all of which the garden variety user misses in the headlong rush to read their email."</p><p>"Well, it can't be that good if you can't agree about whether the glitch you saw would have any effect or not."</p><p>"There's miles of power and data cabling in this building, a large transformer in the basement, UPS in the machine room and smaller UPS units in the comms rooms. Predicting the effect of a power glitch here is about as easy as predicting the landing of space debris."</p><p>"Yes, but anyone could look at a monitor and notice a red icon," the Boss comments.</p><p>At this point I realise that our Boss will never care that both the PFY and myself can extract, over the top of meaningless conversation, aging air-conditioning, canned music and fan hum, the muffled urgent tones of a piezoelectric beeper warning of a hardware fault - from three rooms away.</p><p>"It's not about seeing a red icon," the PFY says patiently. "It's about knowing a red icon is about to light up or sensing that something is wrong. You can't teach someone that."</p><p>“It’s hearing a subtle change in the hum from a UPS and knowing that it needs a coolant top-up,” I add.</p><p>“And you get all this from the admin... gene?”</p><p>“Oh yes,” The PFY says. “If you’re born with the admin gene it’s just... instinctive.”</p><p>“And I don’t have that gene?” the Boss says.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“So what do I have instead?”</p><p>“I dunno – what’s the one that causes Asperger's?” the PFY asks unkindly.</p><p>“So tell me more about this gene then,” the Boss says dryly. “You make it sound like a superpower.”</p><p>“Well, in a way it sort of is,” I say. “There’s no seeing through walls or anything but there’s a lot of that sixth sense stuff.”</p><p>“I find that very hard to believe...”</p><p>“It’s true,” the PFY says.</p><p>“I...”</p><p>“He’s right,” I interject. “It’s just an inbuilt ability to KNOW things – like when to put a cleaning tape into a drive before it tells you.”</p><p>“Or how hard to hit a stuck hard drive to get it moving again...” the PFY says.</p><p>“...without breaking it completely,” I add. “But it’s not just about systems – it’s also about the environment.”</p><p>“Like when not to answer the phone.”</p><p>“Or when to hide behind the door.”</p><p>“And how to tell when a door handle might be electrified,” the PFY continues.</p><p>“Not to mention the computer suite environment,” I add. “Like when it’s 17.8 degrees instead of 18.”</p><p>“Or 60 per cent humidity instead of 45.”</p><p>“Anyone can do that,” the Boss snaps – obviously feeling left out. “You never know – I might have the gene and just not know it.”</p><p>“I doubt it – but we’re happy to test it if you really think you have what it takes.”</p><p>“I DO!”</p><p>“Okay then, go into the server room and tell us what the humidity is – without looking at the aircon unit.”</p><p>“You’re on.”</p><p>“How’s he doing?” the PFY says, as the Boss stalks down the corridor to the computer room.</p><p>“Well... he’s just about to fail the electrified door handle test.”</p><p>“Woah!" the PFY says, looking up quickly.</p><p>"Woah what?" the helldesk supervisor asks, walking into the room.</p><p>"Nah, it'll be OK," I say to the PFY, ignoring the helldesk supervisor for a moment.</p><p>Well, it passes the time, doesn’t it?</p>
