            <h3>EPISODE 8 </h3>
            <br /><p></p><p>"I... uh..." the Boss says, wandering into Mission Control aimlessly, searching for the right words to bring up whatever's on his mind.</p><p>"Yes?" I ask, letting him off the hook.</p><p>"The lifts" he says cryptically..</p><p>"The lifts?" I repeat..</p><p>"The buttons on the lifts" he says.</p><p>"They have buttons - yes - well spotted," I say.</p><p>"They've got more buttons."</p><p>"More than?"</p><p>"The building has extra floors," he finally blurts. "Now there's buttons for floors 7 to 12."</p><p>"You mean the building gets bigger if you add buttons to the lift?!" the PFY says. "Like the buttons are actually an array of floor pointers?!?"</p><p>"Oooh yeah," I say, getting in on the act. "So you could push 8 and it does a new(floor)."</p><p>"And maybe you could do it so if you held the button down it does a destroy (floor ) then a new (floor)!"</p><p>"For the 4th floor," I say, wondering how the Beancounters would cope with sudden non-existence.</p><p>The Boss' blank expression indicates that this conversation is wasted on him.</p><p>"The lift control panels have apparently been recalled for saftey reasons," the PFY sighs. "The only spare panels they had in stock were for taller buildings."</p><p>Which is not entirely the truth. The truth was revealed a couple of days ago.</p><p>"Look what I scored!" the PFY says.</p><p>"Some... lift control panels?" I ask.</p><p>"Yeah, they're renovating the building down the street and I noticed these were going to be chucked out."</p><p>"They were in the bin?"</p><p>"Not exactly."</p><p>"In a wheelbarrow destined for the bin?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"On the floor outside the lifts?"</p><p>"Ah..."</p><p>"In the lift, with the power connected, in the building which isn't being renovated?"</p><p>"Well, yes. But I was thinking, we could swap these with our panels and then use the extra buttons for special controls."</p><p>"Special controls like?"</p><p>"Well, you press the 8th floor button, it delivers you to the ground floor and sends a text message to the Indian down the street to order two chicken vindaloos, some chilli bhajis, a couple of garlic naans and four Kingfishers."</p><p>"But wouldn't that mean that they'd be inundated with orders every time idiot tested the button?"</p><p>"You'd think so, but then it would only be active outside of work hours."</p><p>"After 4pm, except on Fridays, when it's on after 12pm."</p><p>"Yes, well, I might need to think about that one a little."</p><p>"So we'd just use the lift control panel as a form of ordering system?"</p><p>"Not necessarily. Press floor 9 and it'll take you to whatever floor the hottest woman in the building is on."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Of course not. It doesn't do that - but it could do if you thought it was a good idea."</p><p>"And Floor 10?"</p><p>"The floor 10 button would take you up and down in the lift randomly for 15 minutes - without opening the doors or stopping at floors. At variable speeds."</p><p>"11?"</p><p>"The same as 9, but for 30 minutes."</p><p>"And don't tell me, 12 is for an hour. So if you pressed 12 and 9 it would be one hour, 15 minutes of lift joyriding?"</p><p>"No, 12 will gas you with a vapourised version of rohypnol before taking you to Basement 1 - where the creepy Courier Guy parks his van. You know, the one with the tinted windows. I like the binary addition of button travel times idea though."</p><p>"Gassing them and dropping them off in the basement's a little cruel don't you think?"</p><p>"No, cruel's dropping the ceiling tile with 'all you can eat' written on the back of it onto the lift floor."</p><p>"Ah, yes, Rule 2, the double tap... You've given this a lot of thought haven't you?"</p><p>"It passes the time between pub visits," the PFY nods.</p><p>"And it only works when it's enabled?"</p><p>"When it's enabled or when you press the floor number with the DOOR OPEN button held down. I thought we could use it like a shift key - that way all the other buttons could do something special too."</p><p>...</p><p>"Well, I gave them a call and get the lifts fixed properly as I was stuck in there for quarter of an hour this morning," the Boss says. "But they say they don't know anything about the panels."</p><p>"Really? Must be a different crew. Did you speak to anyone else about this?"</p><p>Crap Segue Tip: If anyone, anytime - even if you're not in a movie - says "did you speak to anyone else about this?" say 'yes'.</p><p>"No, not yet."</p><p>... half an hour later...</p><p>"Has anyone seen Jerry?" the IT Director asks, looking around for the Boss.</p><p>"Haven't seen him all day," the PFY responds.</p><p>Crap Segue followup: Told you so.</p><p>"Oh. Only there's a couple of people at reception who've got a meeting scheduled with him. Some chaps who do cloud computing - whatever that is. Sounds like something we should be looking into though."</p><p>"You know, I think I saw him on the 7th floor." the PFY says.</p><p>"Does this building have a 7th floor?"</p><p>"Yes, it's just some sort of optical illusion that makes the building seem smaller."</p><p>"OK, I'll send them up there then."</p><p>"No, you need to have a company swipe card to get access."</p><p>"OK I'll take them up."</p><p>"Good idea," the PFY says.</p><p>. . .</p><p>"7th floor?" I ask as soon as the Boss leaves.</p><p>"Same as 12 but it also sends a text message to the courier to say his packages are ready and bring the big van..."</p><p>"It's still... I dunno... a little cruel," I say.</p><p>"What about if I text him and tell him if he's not on 7 he'll be on 8?"</p><p>"And we'll pop down for a quick ruby? OK then, you talked me into it..."</p>
