            <h2>In BOFH office, squeaky wheel greases you </h2>
            <h3>EPISODE 17 </h3>
            <br /><p></p><p>“So what do the following have in common?” the Boss seethes “My desk drawer, the complaints box at reception and the boot of the deputy CEO’s car?”</p><p>“They’re all places you can take a dump?” the PFY asks, pouring a little petrol on the flames of the Boss’ annoyance.</p><p>“WHAT!?”</p><p>“You’ll have to forgive my assistant” I interject quickly “He often uses the word ‘can’ when he really means ‘should’.”</p><p>What the hell, in for a penny and all that...</p><p>“No!” the Boss snaps back “They’re all places which have been broken into in the last couple of weeks.”</p><p>“To take a dump?” the PFY asks</p><p>“No, to steal things!”</p><p>“What would be in any of those that someone would want to steal?”</p><p>“There’s a lot of valuable things in my office for a start!” the Boss snaps back.</p><p>“You mean like the bit of paper under your keyboard with your password and safe combination on it?”</p><p>“You know my safe combination?!?!” the Boss gasps</p><p>“Even the CLEANER knows your safe combination,” I reply “Besides, there’s nothing valuable in your drawer or your safe.”</p><p>“And how do you know that?”</p><p>“BECAUSE THE CLEANER KNOWS YOUR SAFE COMBINATION!”</p><p>“So you’re saying the cleaner broke into those places?” the Boss asks, detective work not being his strong suit</p><p>“No I’m saying the cleaner wouldn’t need to break into those places because he’s the person who shuts your safe and locks your drawer when you leave them open.” I reply</p><p>“And knows where the key’s kept” the PFY adds</p><p>The problem with talking to middle management occurs when they lose focus, often happening when you’re talking about password complexity policy and why someone’s initials don’t count as complex – or when you’re describing the smtp protocol and how it’s not really designed to send that DVD you just ripped to your friend’s Yahoo account.</p><p>And so it is that the boss has timed out of the conversation. Before he can switch to hibernate, I draw him back into the conversation by mentioning security robots once more. Nothing drags a bloke back to the light quicker than 1 part gadget mixed with 2 parts potential danger.</p><p>“I thought they were all broken.”</p><p>“They are” the PFY says “and fraught with bugs. What we’re suggesting is that we build our own security robots – to make sure we record whoever’s breaking into things.”</p><p>“They can’t have weapons!” the Boss cautions</p><p>“No weapons needed” I say “All we really want is a camera and the ability to move around.”</p><p>“No lifts or stairwells!” the Boss snaps again, thinking of the recent past</p><p>“Fine. We could make robots that simply stay on a floor and observe.”</p><p>“I’m not going to spend a lot of money!” he cautions</p><p>“And why would you?” I ask, making a sweeping gesture into the room “When we have all the raw materials on hand!”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“Oh, just parts from some servers, laptops, printers – plus the odd vending machine – etc. In fact we have three of them up and running in the building already”</p><p>“Where?” the Boss asks</p><p>“Well the first one we activated a few minutes ago” I reply “– the vending machine on the Balcony of level 6. It works like a vending machine but is also a completely mobile surveillance device. Has a 12 sector movement detector along with a wireless lan connection for voice and video plus inbuilt facial recognition. It can transmit a suspect’s movements while monitoring their head movements as well. The moment it detects someone looking at it, it becomes a static vending machine again”</p><p>“You know, like the statues on Doctor Who.” the PFY adds.</p><p>“I... And this is up and running now?” the Boss gasps</p>
