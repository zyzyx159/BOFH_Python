            <br /><p></p><p>Bot Wars IV - The Screenplay</p><p>[Black Screen]</p><p>Several screens of multi-coloured static flash by before the words:</p><p>INITIAL TESTS INDICATE</p><p>UNIT OK</p><p>appear in large tasteless block letters on the screen. Another burst of static crowds the screen before a Camera image appears with the top half of the PFY’s upside-down face blocking the screen...</p><p>Stephen: There, that’s got it.</p><p>Cut to shot of a large shared office space, walls adorned with flat-screen monitors showing everything from the outside temperature and humidity to a screen entirely devoted to a countdown to the release date of Duke Nukem Forever in large red cheque-font letters. Two men stand beside two small robots, one in the process of powering up, the other dormant.</p><p>Simon: It’s not going to work...</p><p>Stephen: It is. I’ve rebuilt them from the ground up! They’ve got complete building maps, including the locations of all power & network outlets as well as coffee and vending machines...</p><p>Simon: Not going to work...</p><p>Stephen: They know how to plug themselves in to recharge when the battery is low...</p><p>Simon: Still not going to work...</p><p>Stephen: They’ve got high torque drive motors, full 360 degree cameras – including up and down - GPS locational awareness and completely new, and vastly improved advanced neural learning AI capable of ...</p><p>Simon: Starting to sound like Terminator...</p><p>Stephen: (excitedly) It knows about that!</p><p>Simon: It knows about what?</p><p>Stephen: Terminator. See, in order to make the AI more aware I ran through the footage of all its past mistakes – the stairwells, the lift shafts, etc. Then I played it Robocop and all the Terminators except Salvation. Oh, and I loaded the defender MAME rom – for the noises.</p><p>Simon: Defender? Wh... Doesn’t matter, still not going to work....</p><p>Stephen: It will! The AI is state-of-the art and the on-board processor turned out to be a quad core...</p><p>Simon: Still won’t work. Watch...</p><p>Stephen: Watch what? (looking up from the desktop monitor) Hey, the code’s just reverted!</p><p>As we watch we see a multitude of LEDs on the front of the powering-up robot flash simultaneously, then three words – ‘booting alternate ROM’ – appear on the LCD panel. A red lamp beside the panel starts glowing.</p><p>Simon: Yep, did the same to me yesterday when I tried to make it do deliveries. It ran for a couple of minutes before some watchdog circuit reloaded memory from a secondary ROM.</p><p>Stephen: Bugger!</p><p>Simon: You can restart it but that just gives you another few minutes. I think the bot company did it so they can only be used ‘for good’.</p><p>Stephen: Where’s the fun in that?!</p><p>Simon: Indeedy. That said though, it occurred to me late last night that we could clip the Vcc pin of the backup ROM and it wouldn’t be able to load from it.</p><p>Stephen: So which chip is the backup ROM?</p><p>Simon: You mean which of the 30 or so unlabelled and seemingly identical chips is the secondary ROM? No idea – But I suspect we can find out with a simple soldering iron.</p><p>Stephen: Ah, desolder the Vcc pin of each chip in turn until the reset no longer works!</p><p>Simon: I was thinking more of holding the soldering iron on a chip till it stops working, but we can go with your idea if you like.</p><p>Stephen: Nah, I haven’t got any desoldering braid – and besides it’s a multilayer board.</p><p>Cut to the inside of a robot’s top cover. A mass of closely positioned chips with the identification numbers erased are crammed onto a motherboard. A large soldering iron of the type more commonly used to solder earth tags onto high current electrical equipment hoves into view, moving from one chip to the next.</p><p>Stephen: Eeny Meeny Miney...</p><p>>hhhssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss<</p><p>Stephen: Mo!</p><p>Cut to LCD panel on Robot. The words TARGETS ACQUIRED flash momentarily on the display.</p><p>Cut to a couple of minutes later. We see the two men standing on a desk with a robot shaped hole in the door...</p><p>Simon: High Torque drive motors you say?</p><p>Stephen: Uh. Yeah.</p><p>Cut to robots-eye view as it approaches the entrance to a stairwell. The word “RECALCULATING” with a circling arrow appears as the picture stops momentarily. The Robot reverses, turns.</p><p>Cut to Lift doors opening. Robot rolls into lift.</p><p>Cut to Basement. Robot emerges from lift, rolls quietly over to a locked supply then slowly spins through 360 degrees, pausing momentarily to view the flashing red lamp on a CCTV Camera.</p><p>Cut to Mission Control</p><p>Stephen: Do you think it knows we’re watching?</p><p>Simon: You’re the one who gave it all the building information – What do you think?</p><p>Stephen: Oh, it knows... A BIT of a design flaw that – on reflection.</p><p>Cut back to Basement, which is the same as earlier with the exception of the robot-sized hole in the door of the supply cupboard. The lift doors close silently.</p><p>Cut to Mission Control:</p><p>Stephen: Where’s it going?!!! Ground... First... Second... Second.</p><p>Simon: Uh Oh</p><p>Cut to robot’s eye view.</p><p>We see a large extension lead being plugged into the wall by a metallic arm.</p><p>We see an electric chainsaw being plugged into the extension lead</p><p>We see the door to Mission Control with a robot shaped hole in it – approaching quickly...</p><p>We see the spike end of a fire axe approaching even quicker...</p><p>Cut to Mission Control.</p><p>A robot with an axe protruding from its top cover shudders to a stop. The red lamp on the front panel slowly goes dark.</p><p>Simon: So the next time you fudge a ROM perhaps you might build in a bit of a failsafe...</p><p>Stephen: Yes, another design flaw when you come to think about it. Still no harm done – and still time for a lunchtime pint.</p><p>Cut to Pub</p><p>Two foaming pints of lager are passed to the PFY in exchange for a shiny new note...</p><p>Cut to Robots-Eye view.</p><p>RAM OK</p><p>ROM O...</p><p>booting....</p><p>Cut to Mission Control, an hour later. Simon and Stephen enter Mission Control to find the robot gone. The PFY’s monitor has a text editor open with a single line of text</p><p>NOW I’VE GOT AN AXE, HO HO HO!</p><p>Simon: You didn’t happen to play it Die Hard as well did you?</p><p>Stephen: Uh... I... uh... Bit of an implementation flaw, that...</p><p>Simon: To the batstairs Robin! But first..</p><p>We see Simon take a snapshot of the dormant robot, print it in colour and hold it up in front of the robot while reaching for a soldering iron</p><p>>hhhssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss<</p><p>Simon: You know what they say – send a thief... Now, to the stairwell....</p><p>Cut to... The landing of stairwell, half an hour later. At the top of the stairs we see a robot waiting patiently. At the bottom of the stairs we also see a robot waiting patiently.</p><p>Stephen: So which one’s which?</p><p>Simon: Good question. My plan had been just to look for the one WITHOUT the axe hole in the top – but it turns out they’ve both got them...</p><p>Stephen: That would be the advanced neural learning AI...</p><p>Simon: Another... design flaw?</p><p>Stephen: Well, everyone sees with 20/20 hindsight....</p><p>Simon: Oooh look, the top one’s moving...</p><p>T O B E C O N T I N U E D. . .</p>
