            <h3>EPISODE 6 </h3>
            <br /><p></p><p>EXT: COUNTRYSIDE</p><p>A lush pasture with snow-capped mountains in the distance. A fluffy white rabbit hops into shot, stops and nibbles on some grass.</p><p>[Dissolve to...]</p><p>INT: BOSS'S OFFICE</p><p>The BASTARD, PFY and BOSS are clustered around the screen of the Boss's desktop machine.</p><p>PFY</p><p>See, he just pushes his machine off the desk!</p><p>BASTARD</p><p>And 20 minutes later so does that guy.</p><p>BOSS</p><p>So this footage - it's just showing four of the company's financial people deliberately destroying their workstations?</p><p>PFY</p><p>Yes! But that's not all - about ten other machines in the building were damaged the same way in the past 24 hours!</p><p>BOSS</p><p>Any idea why they'd do it?</p><p>PFY</p><p>No.</p><p>BOSS</p><p>Or why they'd all choose to do it on the same day?</p><p>PFY</p><p>None whatsoever.</p><p>INT: PUB</p><p>[caption: 'Last Friday night']</p><p>The PFY, very much the worse for wear, is at the bar. Beside him is a BEANCOUNTER, looking nervous.</p><p>PFY (shouting, slurred)</p><p>I'M TELLING YOU, JUST PUSH IT OFF YOUR DESK! NO ONE'S GOING TO BELIEVE YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE! EVEN IF THEY SEE YOU DO IT, NO ONE'S GOING TO BELIEVE IT WAS DELIBERATE!</p><p>BEANCOUNTER</p><p>Yes, well, thank you, I suppose, I'll certainly...</p><p>INT: BOSS'S OFFICE</p><p>PFY (blankly)</p><p>Nope. No idea at all.</p><p>INT: PUB</p><p>PFY</p><p>JUST DO IT! LIKE THE SHOES! JUST PUSH THE MACHINE OFF THE DESK! HONESTLY, NO ONE REALLY THINKS YOU'D DO IT. AND WHEN IT'S BROKEN THEY'LL HAVE TO REPLACE IT - IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'LL REPAIR THEM!</p><p>INT: BOSS'S OFFICE</p><p>BOSS</p><p>We'll have to repair them.</p><p>BASTARD</p><p>Beg pardon?</p><p>BOSS</p><p>We'll have to repair them.</p><p>BASTARD</p><p>But they're crapped out P4s!</p><p>BOSS</p><p>That may be, but they still have an expected lifetime.</p><p>PFY</p><p>The same could be said about you - but we wouldn’t put money on it...</p><p>BOSS</p><p>Pardon?</p><p>PFY</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>BASTARD</p><p>But we don't have time to repair them!</p><p>BOSS</p><p>Perhaps you could teach your users to repair them?</p><p>PFY</p><p>You mean teach users something?</p><p>BOSS</p><p>Yes.</p><p>PFY</p><p>Teach them to take the covers off a box?</p><p>BOSS</p><p>Yes.</p><p>PFY</p><p>You know that’s a bad idea, right?</p><p>BOSS</p><p>How bad could it be?</p><p>INT: MEETING ROOM</p><p>Six beancounters stand behind tables on which their desktop machines are standing. The PFY addresses them.</p><p>PFY</p><p>OK, so the first thing we’re going to get you to do is to take the covers off your machines. So make sure that your machine is orientated so that the serial ports are at the lowest point...</p><p>BEANCOUNTER</p><p>What’s a serial port?</p><p>The PFY sighs deeply.</p><p>[Fade to 10 minutes later]</p><p>PFY</p><p>OK, so we’ve now found the serial ports on everyone’s machines and started undoing the screws holding the top panel in. We’ve also discovered the screws holding the power supply in, the nuts holding the serial port in, and one of you managed to undo two of the screws holding your desk together. So we’re making progress. Now, before we take the top panel off, what should we do?</p><p>BEANCOUNTER</p><p>Draw an arrow on the lid to show which way it goes back on again.</p><p>PFY</p><p>Or we could just remember sticky label is at the front?</p><p>BEANCOUNTER</p><p>Oh.</p><p>PFY</p><p>Anything else?</p><p>BEANCOUNTER</p><p>Ah...</p><p>PFY</p><p>Yes?</p><p>BEANCOUNTER</p><p>Er... protect the machine from static electricity?</p><p>PFY</p><p>Very good – if your intention was to make sure that your machine was able to be repaired. If, however, your intention was to make your machine unrepairable we probably wouldn’t do that. We also wouldn’t make sure that the voltage selector was on 240 and not accidentally set to 115 – for those of you with a power supply with a switch on it. Anything else we wouldn’t do?</p><p>BEANCOUNTER</p><p>We... wouldn’t not spill liquids inside the machine.</p><p>SECOND BEANCOUNTER (excitedly)</p><p>We wouldn’t drop it on the floor again?!!</p><p>PFY</p><p>That’s right, we wouldn’t not drop it on the floor again. Only this time you need to all do it at the same time so that it doesn’t look orchestrated.</p><p>THIRD BEANCOUNTER</p><p>But if we all do it at the same time wouldn’t it look even more like it were orchestrated?</p><p>PFY</p><p>Ordinarily, yes – which is why I brought this with me...</p><p>The PFY opens a small box and removes a roll of uninsulated copper wire.</p><p>INT: CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE MEETING ROOM</p><p>Suddenly the building lights go out and the battery power EXIT lamp light in the hallway illuminates. A tiny wisp of smoke trickles under the bottom of the door.</p><p>INT: BOSS’S OFFICE</p><p>The PFY, BASTARD and Boss look at each other.</p><p>PFY</p><p>There’s been a terrible accident!</p><p>BASTARD</p><p>So the room’s free then?</p><p>PFY</p><p>It will be after lunch. I’ve got one more class. What’s on the menu?</p><p>BASTARD</p><p>Rabbit pie, I think...</p>
