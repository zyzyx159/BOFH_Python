            <h3>EPISODE 3 </h3>
            <br /><p> "How bad is it really?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"It's bad." the PFY whispers with some urgency. "It's like the Y2K thing times 10!"</p><p>And given that the Y2K thing was a big fat zero, the PFY is technically correct.</p><p>"What are we looking at?" the Director asks.</p><p>"Well I don't think it's at the level of human sacrifice and dogs and cats living together yet, but it's bad," I say.</p><p>"I..." the Boss starts, then thinks the better of it. "What do we do?"</p><p>"I don't know. I mean obviously you're going to have to prepare for a world with different Paint and Minesweeper but the rest of it – well it's anyone's guess."</p><p>"Paint and Minesweeper are gone?" the Boss blurts, no doubt wondering what he's going to be doing to fill in his day.</p><p>"Gone. Replaced with 'better' alternatives."</p><p>"Isn't there something you can do? Are they hidden somewhere or can they be downloaded?"</p><p>"No" I lie. "They'll be gone."</p><p>"Can't we just leave things as they are?" he whines.</p><p>"What, you mean without support, updates and security?" I gasp.</p><p>"I... suppose you're right. But what are we going to do?"</p><p>"Upgrades. We have to upgrade everything," the PFY says.</p><p>"The users won't like it."</p><p>"We're not worried about the users, we're worried about everything else!" I say.</p><p>"What... else?"</p><p>"The lift controller is a Windows 7 machine," the PFY says.</p><p>(It's not.)</p><p>"And the aircon – that's got a Windows 7 controller."</p><p>(Nope.)</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Yep!" the PFY says. "Not to mention the security system, the BMS system, and the drinking water service controller computer."</p><p>(Nope, nope, and there isn't one.)</p><p>"So what are we going to have to do?"</p><p>"My priorities are the underlying infrastructure – the users will have to come second in this instance," I say.</p><p>"Why did no one know anything about this?" our IT Director asks.</p><p>"We mentioned it multiple times. Your predecessors adopted the tried and true Climate Change methodology of ignoring impending disaster."</p><p>"What do we do NOW?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"For a start you'll need to pay that Windows 10 preparedness consultant's bill," the PFY says, no doubt contemplating the cheque he'll want made out to "Computer Assistance Service Helpline".</p><p>"Right," the Boss nods.</p><p>"Order these two new desktops >shuffle< to replace the ones that couldn't be upgraded."</p><p>"Uh, yes," he says, with a tinge of doubt in his voice, if I'm not mistaken.</p><p>"Order these graphics cards, monitors, keyboards and headsets."</p><p>"Uh... that's a little excessive isn't it?"</p><p>"Sorry?"</p><p>"It says here that you want a gaming headset, mouse and keyboard."</p><p>"Of course. Gaming gear's built for resiliency. You hardly want your lift crashing into the sub-basement 40 metres per second because a cheap keyboard switch didn't open at the right time."</p><p>"Oh... I.. but headsets? Why do those machines need headsets?"</p><p>"You mean why would I need a headset to Skype to the PFY to tell him how to reset the security system to let people out of the basement?"</p><p>"Oh, I see."</p><p>"And why are you getting them delivered to your homes?" the Director asks.</p><p>"It's simple" I explain, as if to an idiot "they'll require advanced configuration which needs to be done precisely and sequentially. We can't have people interrupting us when the installation is going on."</p><p>"What advanced configurations that?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"Hardware drivers, BIOS handshaking, flux capacitor decoupling. Miss one of those steps and you're left with an expensive pile of melted copper and a couple of 3ft beancounters at the bottom of a lift shaft with knees where their hips should be..."</p><p>"Ah."</p><p>"So obviously we'd do the complete install, swap the computers over after hours and it'll be so smooth it'll seem like nothing happened."</p><p>"And how would we KNOW that something had happened?" the Boss asks, the seeds of doubt sprouting blooms of suspicion.</p><p>"I guess I could drop the old machines off to you," I say.</p><p>"Yes, but how would we know that you didn't pick up a couple of dusty old relics at a car boot sale?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"Just tell your wife and sister-in-law not to go car-boot-sale-ing that weekend," the PFY chips in.</p><p>...</p><p>"I think maybe we should just take a couple of steps back here," the Director says, once the shouting has stopped and the ozone smell of the Boss's impromptu "sedation" has started to waft out the air-conditioning relief vents.</p><p>"Hmm.." the Boss says blankly.</p><p>"Look, it's simple," I say. "We replace those two desktop machines, then we start to roll out the rest of the infrastructure before moving on to the users."</p><p>"Yes, but how do we protect the users meantime?"</p><p>"Good point. I think that there's really only one way of protecting the company," I say.</p><p>"Replacing every desktop in the building?" the Director asks.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Mmmmm mm mnnn?" The Boss drools.</p><p>"Probably not," I reply.</p><p>"Relying on the antivirus software, spam protection and firewall which already protects us?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Yes – but also."</p><p>"Oh, clicking on the 'Don't remind me again' text?"</p><p>"Precisely."</p><p>(See, and no one even had to mention moving to Linux and Libre office.)</p>
