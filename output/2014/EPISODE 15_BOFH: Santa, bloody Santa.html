            <br /><p></p><p>"HE PUNCHED HIM IN THE FACE!" the Director shouts, gesturing both wildly and furiously at the absent PFY's desk.</p><p>"Well yes," I say calmly, "but let's be reasonable about this - he WAS asking for it."</p><p>"HE WASN'T BLOODY ASKING FOR IT!" the Director shouts again - in serious danger of bursting one or two major cranium-based blood vessels if I'm not mistaken.</p><p>"He was," I said. "He was saying inappropriate things."</p><p>"What was he saying?"</p><p>"He said that we we’d all be using MacBooks in five years."</p><p>"I… W… THERE WERE CHILDREN PRESENT!"</p><p>"Which is why the PFY felt he had to act - impressionable minds and all that. He has a very strong sense of civic duty."</p><p>"I DON'T CARE WHAT SORT OF SENSE YOU HAVE, YOU CAN'T PUNCH SANTA IN THE FACE AT A CHRISTMAS FAMILY DAY AND EXPECT TO GET AWAY WITH IT!"</p><p>"He was alright," I say, still speaking in soothing tones. "It was just a couple of cuts and bruises."</p><p>"AND A BLOODY NOSE!"</p><p>“Yes, well, all water under the bridge now – or rather blood on the carpet. Was that what you came to see us about then?”</p><p>"Yes. But I'm not done! HR have asked me to make sure he gets this, which is a letter outlining the serious misconduct event – that this incident is being treated as..." the Director says, handing over an envelope.</p><p>"It outlines that he'll be expected to attend a meeting at 11am tomorrow to discuss this issue and that he's entitled to have an employment relations adviser and/or a family member present. I assume that you'll be attending as the employment relations adviser?"</p><p>"Uh no."</p><p>"So you won't be attending?"</p><p>"Yes, I'll be attending – but as the family member."</p><p>"You're not family!"</p><p>"I think you'll find that I am!"</p><p>The Director storms out while I have a quick look on the web about adoption procedures.</p><p>. . . The next day . . .</p><p>"Where's Stephen?" the Director asks, banging into Mission Control at 11:15.</p><p>"Oh, he's got the day off."</p><p>"He was supposed to be at the meeting! It was in the letter!"</p><p>"Oh, I put that in the bin," I say.</p><p>"YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE SURE HE GOT IT."</p><p>"I'm pretty sure you said YOU were supposed to make sure he got it. You want to be careful about that sort of thing because non-performance issues like that can really get HR's back up!"</p><p>"RIGHT!"</p><p>He storms back in half an hour later with ANOTHER LETTER.</p><p>"RIGHT, I AM DIRECTING YOU TO ENSURE THAT YOUR ASSISTANT GETS THIS LETTER TOMORROW."</p><p>"Oh, okay. You probably should have told me that in the first place. It would've saved us all a bit of time."</p><p>That blood vessel thing is really not looking too good at all...</p><p>The next day the PFY and I are seated in a meeting room with the Director and a couple of heavyweights (in more ways that one) from the HR department.</p><p>"Shall we get started?" the head HR truffle-womble asks.</p><p>"In a moment" I respond "We're just waiting for our legal counsel."</p><p>"Legal Counsel?"</p><p>"Yes - employment relations person. In our case a solicitor."</p><p>"You have a solicitor?" the HR asks, suppressing amusement.</p><p>"Yes, Gina Barker, Lightfoot, Barker and Ellice," Gina says, popping through the door and extending her hand, withdrawing it just as the truffle wombles reciprocate.</p><p>"You're a lawyer?" the Director asks.</p><p>"Yes - women are lawyers sometimes. I do hope that veiled sexism isn't par for the course in this company."</p><p>"No, it's just that you were a consultant, and..." the Director blusters.</p><p>"...and you didn't know women could do more than one job?" Gina asks.</p><p>It's so nice to see someone else on the other end of this for a change...</p><p>"I think we may have got off on the wrong foot," TW1 says, trying to calm the stormy waters. "As I understand it, you performed some consultancy work for the company and the IT Director was under the impression that you were an IT specialist, not a lawyer."</p><p>"I can be both you know," Gina explains "It's no.."</p><p>"Yes, yes, I know - I didn't mean to imply that it wasn't possible, just unusual," TW1 interrupts.</p><p>"So," Gina continues, "if we could get to the matter at hand, I believe you have some sort of contrived misconduct issue where my client was trying to protect children from harm."</p><p>"Ah, I don't think he was trying to protect anyone," the Director blurts</p><p>"As I understand it from my client there were some offensive statements made repeatedly at which point my client felt oblig..."</p><p>"HE PUNCHED SANTA IN THE FACE!" TW1 snaps.</p><p>"If I might continue. As I understand it he felt a duty of care to protect the children fr..."</p><p>"He wasn't protecting anyone," TW1 interjects.</p><p>"...PROTECT the children from something which might traumatise them in the futu..."</p><p>"Oh, don't be ridiculous," TW1 blurts.</p><p>. . .</p><p>"SHE PUNCHED HIM IN THE FACE!" the Director shouts, gesturing both wildly and furiously at Gina, once the ambulance has left.</p><p>"Well yes," I say calmly. "But let's be reasonable about this – he WAS asking for it."</p>
