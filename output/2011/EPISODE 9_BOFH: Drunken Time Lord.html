            <br /><p></p><p>"It's only 1:30pm!" the PFY grumbles, looking up from his cellphone clock.</p><p>"I know," I say. "It's that variable viscosity of time again."</p><p>"The what now?" the PFY asks</p><p>"The variable viscosity of time. You know, how the viscosity of time is inversely proportional to what you'd like the viscosity to be."</p><p>"You’ve lost me."</p><p>"Okay," I sigh, opening an Excel chart. "Here, on a Monday morning, when there's lots of interesting stuff happening, time flows reasonably well. Friday afternoons however, time flows like road tar on a cold morning."</p><p>"What's that then?" the PFY asks, pointing at another section of the graph.</p><p>"Ah, that was Wednesday evening."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"And I was having a couple of drinks with that nice woman from the inkjet company."</p><p>"And time flowed..."</p><p>"Like water out a firehose."</p><p>"I take it she didn’t know that we don’t have any inkjet printers at that stage?"</p><p>"Correct. You can see the rapid incline of the graph at >this< point when she found out. A section I like to call 'the long walk home'."</p><p>"And yet it's still wasn’t as bad as Friday afternoons?"</p><p>"Yes, well-spotted. It seems that alcohol reduces the viscosity of time."</p><p>"So time flows faster when you're drinking?"</p><p>"Exactly. So while in real time the walk home took three hours plus kebab stops, to my mind it was five minutes and someone stuffed a kebab wrapper in my letterbox."</p><p>"So it really does speed things up?"</p><p>"It does. I checked today by spending lunchtime at the pub. Eight minutes."</p><p>"You were gone for two hours!"</p><p>"I know!"</p><p>"So were you at a pub in the morning about five weeks back?"</p><p>"No, why?"</p><p>"The graph says you were!"</p><p>"No, the graph says that time was flowing fast."</p><p>"And the difference is?"</p><p>"The difference is that was the time I was using my wireless mouse on the Boss' machine to quit without saving every time he tried to send an email."</p><p>"I see. And... two mornings ago?"</p><p>"That was when the Boss was trapped in the glass-walled lift of the atrium after unknowingly consuming several pieces of laxative chocolate."</p><p>"So time was moving slowly for him?"</p><p>"Exactly. And this is the interesting thing – and where I think my thesis will shine out – in 'The general theory of relativity of the viscosity of time'."</p><p>"?"</p><p>"The viscosity of time is relative to each person. Much like Einstein's work, an observer sees time flow differently than perhaps the subject being observed."</p><p>"Ah – so while for the Boss, trapped in the elevator, time was travelling excruciatingly slowly, for you..."</p><p>"...watching the Boss crap his strides rather than be seen dropping a grogan in a glass-wall lift, it was all over too soon. Which leads me to believe that the viscosity of time is affected by several things: Alcohol, Romance, the presence of large sums in untraceable five-pound notes and witnessing the misfortune of someone who truly deserves it – especially someone who has crossed you in the recent past."</p><p>"Really?" the PFY says dubiously...</p><p>"Really. And to prove it I've organised a very simple demonstration."</p><p>"Uh-oh."</p><p>"No, this doesn't involve you. Well, not as the subject anyway. I have here a suitcase full of unmarked five-pound notes, a table reserved at the pub and a get-to-know-you drink or 10 organised with the new women from the bookshop across the road."</p><p>"How's that relative?"</p><p>"You'll have to wait till we get to the pub..."</p><p>Half an hour, three pints and the arrival of our guests later...</p><p>"And how's it relative?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Right. This >twiddle< is the receiver for a remote camera generally strapped to the underside of a model aeroplane to tape flights. This camera, however, is taped to the front of the Boss's rear-view mirror. Now watch very carefully as I trigger the swapping of the digital inputs of his accelerator and brake pedals..."</p><p>>click<</p><p>"Nothing happened," The PFY says.</p><p>"And yet the pub is empty, it's dark outside, our dates and money are gone and it's 12:15am."</p><p>"Incredible!"</p><p>"I know."</p><p>"And you can't slow it down any?"</p><p>"Not exactly. I have been experimenting with operating systems."</p><p>"Operating systems?"</p><p>"Yes, Windows ME and Vista mainly."</p><p>"And they slow time down?"</p><p>"Well, time certainly seems slower."</p><p>"So you could install Vista on your workplace machine and it would cancel out the effects of time speeding up when you're enjoying yourself?"</p><p>"Except that you would no longer be enjoying yourself..."</p><p>"So time would slow down even more than if it were normal time. OS/2?"</p><p>"Yes – Remember the last episode of Sapphire and Steel where they’re trapped in the box in the middle of space... That would be an OS/2 user – where every day is like the last and every little thing we tried to do would take a millennium."</p><p>"Wow, you could do that to someone?"</p><p>"Yes, like the bloke from Security who wheel-clamped me this morning who had an Operating System 'upgrade' this morning. Now before I switch to camera 2 remember that, with the relativity of the viscosity of time the victim would experience time flowing slowly, but to us, the observer, it would travel extremely fast."</p><p>"So the first thing we knew..."</p><p>"The terminators would be stalking humans, yes."</p><p>"But still, they're computers and we could reason with them..."</p><p>"Yes, I suppose you’re right, it's worth a crack."</p><p>>Click< ®</p>
