            <h3>EPISODE 6 </h3>
            <br /><p></p><p>"There's going to be a takeover!" the PFY gasps, crashing into Mission Control.</p><p>"I thought you saw them off the premises," I reply, "although quite what you sawed off you never made clear. Thanks for that."</p><p>"No, the company – it's being taken over!"</p><p>"Really? Says who?"</p><p>"Says everyone. It's all over the building!"</p><p>Confirmation comes moments later when the Boss cruises into Mission Control with the news.</p><p>"It's the Americans!" he confirms.</p><p>"What, all of them?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"A large corporate. They're acquiring UK assets to diversify."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Yes. All we've got to do is get through the due diligence process and we're sorted."</p><p>"'Sorted' meaning?"</p><p>"'Sorted' meaning we get all get pay rises!"</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Oh yes," The Boss gushes excitedly. "All IT roles are now part of their technical pay scale, which is about 20 per cent above our current scale!!!"</p><p>"Really?" I say. "And what about contractors?"</p><p>"Contractors rates remain the same – BUT – they also have a six monthly bonus based on performance – up to 20 per cent of the salary!"</p><p>"So we're looking at a possible rise as well?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Yes! And an extra week of holiday, free technical subscriptions, at least one overseas training course every year and free social club and gym memberships!"</p><p>"Sounds too good to be true."</p><p>"If you think that's too good to be true wait for this!" he burbles. "The company sponsors two social events a year, is implementing break-out rooms, games rooms, enhance thinking areas, 24x7 pizza ordering, triple overtime and free lunches."</p><p>"It certainly sounds compelling!" The PFY says. "What’s the catch?"</p><p>"There is none!!!!" the Boss chirps, even happier. "It's win-win for everyone. Obviously there's a few changes to be made to fit into their corporate profile, but they're minimal and won't really affect anything ..."</p><p>"Changes?" The PFY asks, before I can get in "What's this corporate profile?"</p><p>"It's the image that the Corporate presents to the world. I mean obviously they want to present the image of a mature and successful company to the world, and to do this they have some guidelines for staff appearance and behaviour – but they're not all that restrictive."</p><p>"How not restrictive?"</p><p>"It's all covered in the staff handbook. And the staff website."</p><p>"The staff handbook?"</p><p>"Yes, you would have got one delivered last night?"</p><p>"That was the handbook!" I gasp "I thought they’d delivered the Greater London Yellow Pages!"</p><p>"I put mine in the shredder," the PFY confesses. "It broke it."</p><p>"Well I suggest you use the website then – it's very informative – it has videos and everything."</p><p>"Videos!" the PFY says, oozing sarcasm...</p><p>...</p>
