            <br /><p></p><p>"I just need you to go through it for me once," the user whines down the line at me.</p><p>"You mean once more?" I reply.</p><p>"Once more?" he snivels.</p><p>"Yes, as I already went through this with you a few weeks ago. You said you understood, you even wrote something down."</p><p>"Really - are you sure that was me?"</p><p>"Positive."</p><p>"How can you be sure?"</p><p>"I just know."</p><p>I could say that I know because I'd recognise the whiney self-righteous voice anywhere. I could say that after 3 visits so far this year alone to explain how to set a card-required door into "bypass" mode I get a premonition every time their number comes up on caller ID.</p><p>But I don't. Instead I just work through it with the user, because that's the excellence-oriented support professional that I am. Well, that I should be. Well, that I read about somewhere. Okay, that I would cross to the other side of conference venue drinking area to avoid.</p><p>"I ..."</p><p>"Do you still have the documentation I emailed you?"</p><p>"Documentation?"</p><p>"Yes, that I emailed you on... >clickety< the first of March. And before that on >scroll< the 15th of February and before that on >scrolly scroll< the 11th of January."</p><p>"I don't think I got the ..."</p><p>"Yes you did, because I have read-receipt switched on and you don't have ignore read-receipt set. I checked."</p><p>"I must have deleted it, I guess."</p><p>"Three times?"</p><p>"I was probably trying to save space - I know you guys are always on about conserving email space."</p><p>"You deleted a 35k message which included a 20k bitmap image to save space?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Instead of any of the ... >clickety< twelve hundred and ... forty one messages in the Recipes subfolder of your Personal folder - each of which is at least 2 Meg in size - including pictures - none of which have any remote connection to your work."</p><p>"Oh, I keep meaning to sort through those, but you know I never really have the time."</p><p>"OR," I bark, "You could just get the mailing list sent to your home email address."</p><p>"Well yes I could, but I prefer to get them at work."</p><p>"Why's that?"</p><p>"Oh, just because -"</p><p>"Can I just interrupt you there?" I interject. "Just a word of warning. If you say - or even hint - that it's because you might want to print them on the very expensive 'True-Colour' auto laminating printer that you had us install just outside your office door there's a very real chance that my assistant will pop upstairs and PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE."</p><p>"Are you threatening me?" he gasps.</p><p>"No, not at all. This is a friendly warning. Like a storm warning in a weather forecast. Think of me as a meteorological expert as far as IT support beatings go. I look at high and low pressure regions and predict - to the best of my abilities - what might come as a result of them. And my long range forecast is a beating on the horizon."</p><p>"I ..."</p><p>"It's the sort of beating they get you to batten your windows for - although obviously it would be foolish to leave a batten laying around your office. Or any other large swingable item. Actually, anything that doesn't have a lot of padding is probably best hidden away ... OR ..."</p><p>"Or?"</p><p>"Or you can take out a pen and paper and write down what I'm about to tell you."</p><p>"Uh, OK."</p><p>"One. Press the A button at the top of the door reader keypad."</p><p>"Uh-huh ..."</p><p>"A picture of a keyboard appears on the display. Two. Type in your four digit code and press the HASH or POUND button."</p><p>"Uh-huh ..."</p><p>"And that's it, the door is free until 5pm."</p><p>"That doesn't seem too hard."</p><p>"No, it doesn't does it? Perhaps the fourth time - this year - is the charm. Although this morning you got your code wrong three times in a row - which set off the alarm, and finally armed the alarm in the office when it was full of people - which set off the alarm once more, resulting in my call."</p><p>"Right, but just to confirm. I press the A key, enter my code, press the hash key."</p><p>"Yep."</p><p>"And that's all?"</p><p>"That's all."</p><p>"It hardly seems possible that I'd forget that."</p><p>"No. And certainly not 3 times in the space of 5 months."</p><p>"Okay, thanks."</p><p>(Not much time passes)</p><p>Goldfish memory cuts in and there's an alarm as the user trips the duress alarm again.</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>"What's going on?" asks the PFY.</p><p>"Nothing. One of our users has forgotten how to set their door into bypass mode again."</p><p>"Which one?"</p><p>"Dave."</p><p>"Dave who?" he asks, a vein beginning to pulse in his temple.</p><p>"Dunno - the bloke on the 3rd floor. The one who's always printing recipes on that laminating printer we put in a couple of we-"</p><p>>Chair overturns, door slams< >Running footsteps receding< >Confused screams, sound as of a heavy laminating printer top being repeatedly opened and slammed shut on a man's head<</p><p>Reap the whirlwind baby, Reap the whirlwind!
