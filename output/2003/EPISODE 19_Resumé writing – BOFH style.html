            <h3>EPISODE 19 </h3>
            <br /><p> BOFH 2003: Episode 19</p><p>"Uh, hello..." one of the helldesk wannabes burbles as he advances cautiously into Mission Control.</p><p>"Mmmm," the PFY answers calmly.</p><p>"I was just wondering if you guys could give me some pointers for my CV."</p><p>"?"</p><p>"Oh, right! I'm applying for a technical role and just wanted some tips on how to put my resumé together to give me a better chance at getting the job!"</p><p>"I see," I respond, leaping into the conversation once I sense blood in the water... "Well, lets see... How to make your CV the one they look at..."</p><p>"Well, there's the obvious things..." the PFY chips in.</p><p>"Yes?" the wannabe asks eagerly.</p><p>"Well a lot of CVs suffer from being far too short. What can you learn about someone in two or three pages? I mean there's barely enough room to list all your primary school grades, let alone the rest of your qualifications?"</p><p>"Primary school grades? Really?"</p><p>"Oh yes, I don't know how many times I've seen them left out of a CV. You see you can tell a lot about a person's character by how well they did in primary school, which subjects and what scores. I mean people cram their CV with tertiary qualifications when every real employer knows those scores are only there to get a job.</p><p>"I prefer that the person leaves out any history of tertiary education," the PFY adds.</p><p>"Really, because this book I have about writing the best resumé says that--"</p><p>"That would be a book written by a person NOT in a technical role? Written to make money out of people wanting technical roles?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>"As opposed to a couple of people who've employed countless people in technical roles?"</p><p>"Yes, I suppose you're right."</p><p>"So anyway, another obvious thing is you want your CV to stand out from the others."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>"So print it on pink paper."</p><p>"PINK?"</p><p>"Yes - it won't get lost and it will stand out from the others."</p><p>"But isn't pink a little... well... effeminate?"</p><p>"NOT if you mention 'Shagging a different bird every night' in your Hobbies and Interests," I counter.</p><p>"Shagging a different bird every night?"</p><p>"Yes, you're right, KNOBBING a different bird every night."</p><p>"Really? Isn't that a bit non-PC?"</p><p>"Yep, but you're after a technical role now, which is predominantly male dominated, so you want to appear to be one of the lads."</p><p>"Oh, I see. What else?"</p><p>"Well you'd better put down drinking as a hobby too."</p><p>"Right, anything else?"</p><p>"Well," the PFY says, "one thing I do like to see on a CV is a photo - and not one of those tiny passport jobbies, I mean a real photo, full page. There was one on a CV recently which was absolutely inspired."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Yeah, the guy was a long distance runner and so he had a full page photo of him in running gear crossing the finish line in a race. You play sport?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Good answer - you're after a technical role after all. Which reminds me, put down 'watching TV' as a hobby too - employers like to know that they'll find their employees at home if they have to be called out after hours.</p><p>"Got any hobbies?"</p><p>"No... I used to play D&D when I was a kid..."</p><p>"Bloody fantastic. Put it in as a hobby, and have a photo of you in D&D gear as the cover page. A wizard or something."</p><p>"Really? I thought just a normal photo of me in a suit..."</p><p>"Which they'll see you in at interview time. You're trying to establish a character that people will remember - right?"</p><p>"Right!"</p><p>"How far did you get with D&D?"</p><p>"I was a 17th level Mage with a +10 Wand of Lightning!" he blurts, unable to suppress the pride.</p><p>"Right - list that in your acheivements. Oh, and put a 'Bronze lifesaving award' in too."</p><p>"Won't they check?"</p><p>"How? Anyway, if it ever came down to it, a bronze lifesaving award only means you're skilled enought to rescue someone from a handbasin, so it won't matter."</p><p>"But what if they find out?"</p><p>"No one ever checks qualifications! So while you're at it slap in some fake certifications - like MCSE, MCSA, CCNA, etc - no one really knows what they mean. If you're asked at the interview just say you didn't bring the certificates because they're framed."</p><p>"Uh-huh."</p><p>"Oh, and best to keep it informal too. So in the covering letter, don't be using things like 'Dear Sir' and 'Yours Sincerely'."</p><p>"No?"</p><p>"No! Use things like 'H3y Dud3z!!!!!' and 'LaT3R l33tR!'"</p><p>"Oh. OK."</p><p>"Well, I think that should think cover it."</p><p>"You missed out criminal record," the PFY adds.</p><p>"Oh, right. Put in something like 'breaking and entering' or 'theft as a servant' a couple of years back."</p><p>"WHY?!?!" the wannabe gasps.</p><p>"Look," the PFY says quietly, glancing around in case we're being listened to. "Occasionally, technical roles call for a little bit of the old thud and blunder - say you need to check out a user's workstation off the record - or maybe they'll want you to wander over to competitors site and uplift some information - at night. They want someone who isn't a career criminal, but who does know how to handle the black-ops, so to speak."</p><p>"Riiiight," he burbles, seeing himself as the James Bond of the technical world. "Thanks, I'll get right onto it!"</p><p>... Three days later ....</p><p>"Morning," the Boss burbles, trundling into the office with benevolence on full beam. "I've just managed to fill that technical role in R&D, and I believe you two were instrumental in helping him with that fantastic CV of his..."</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>I think I'd like to be killed now please... ®</p><p>BOFH is copyright © 1995-2003, Simon Travaglia.
