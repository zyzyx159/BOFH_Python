            <br /><p></p><p>Ah mornings!</p><p>There's nothing like a leisurely cup of coffee, feet up on the table, enjoying the morning news. Well - reading people's email - but same difference.</p><p>"Brown in accounts is sniffing around the new mail room girl again," The PFY comments.</p><p>"Yes, I saw that yesterday - the odd 'what you doing?' message during the day. Where's he at now?"</p><p>"Nonchalantly suggesting that he and a 'few work mates' are meeting up for a 'quick drink' and maybe she'd like to come along 'for a laugh'?"</p><p>"Don't tell me, a pub miles from work - and he's not sent any other email out to his 'mates'?"</p><p>"Precisely!"</p><p>"I thought he was chatting up Jenny in Payroll?"</p><p>"Yes, he's doing that too."</p><p>"Oooh, wouldn't it be a bloody tragedy..."</p><p>"...If >clickety< their mail got mixed up due to some horrible MTA error and they found >clickety< out about each other? Oh look at that!"</p><p>"The course of true love is never smooth" I sigh. "What about The Boss, what's he up to and when's he back?"</p><p>>clickety<</p></p><p>"Back today, was at a >click< SAN presentation in Kent. Oh, you're not going to believe this!"</p><p>"What?" I ask, not wanting to miss out on the morning funny.</p><p>"He booked travel insurance."</p><p>"To KENT? He may as well book travel insurance on the Tube!"</p><p>"No, it would probably cost more for the tube - more risk,.."</p><p>"True. What was he insured for?"</p><p>"Uhhhmmm - mainly medical?"</p><p>"Medical? He's got company health insurance, hasn't he?"</p><p>"Hypochondriac Alert?"</p><p>"Must be - We'll have to find that out when he gets in. It's essential for worker-boss bonding to keep up to date with people! But first some calls!!" I cry, phoning the company doctor…</p><p>"Hello?"</p><p>"Yes," I burble in a worried manner. "I'm a BIT concerned about The Boss. He's been a bit... uh… stressed... lately, and, well, irrational. I think He might have that cleanness thing like what Howard Hughes had?"</p><p>"It's not very likely. People with germ phobia shun the contact of others. He'd be unlikely to turn up to work if that were the case."</p><p>"It's just..."</p><p>"OK, OK, I might stop by to see, but no promises."</p><p>…Later that morning when the boss trundles in…</p><p>"…and I bought this CD in for you people to look at. It's an actual model of a working SAN, which you can run up on your desktop."</p><p>"Oh, I'd like a look at that!" The PFY gasps joyfully, "I've been wanting to get a lo.. lo.. loo.. AAAAAACCCCHHHHHHHEEEWW!"</p><p>What The PFY's sneezes lack in authenticity, they more than make up for in spray, and I make a mental note to hose my desk down before I use it again...</p><p>"Sorry about that," The PFY blurts "Touch of the Flu. Must have picked it up when I took the new girl in the mailroom to see the Chinese Ballet Company."</p><p>"You went to the Chinese Ballet?" the Boss whimpers, edging back slightly.</p><p>"Yeah, she loves the stuff, and a mate of a mate knew the stagehands, so we got in free and got to meet all the players!"</p><p>"I don't remember any Chinese Ballet being on?" the Boss says. Obviously a closet culture vulture.</p><p>"Well you wouldn't - they only played for a couple of days then the whole thing was cancelled and they shifted off back home to Beijing like a flash!"</p><p>"What did your friend say?"</p><p>"Dunno, haven't been able to get hold of him. The phone rings and rings, but no answer - which is strange because he normally puts the answerphone on when he's out."</p><p>I personally think The PFY's laying it on so thick he may as well be driving a manure spreader, but The Boss is lapping it up.</p><p>"Really?" he muffles, through the hanky that's suddenly over his face. "Sorry, runny nose."</p><p>"Yes, that's how this started!" The PFY adds, looking around for a tissue.</p><p>"SARS," The Boss mouths silently,</p><p>"Sorry?" I respond, while The PFY has the decency to make a real show of not turning back around.</p><p>"SARS VIRUS!" he again mouths.</p><p>"VIRUS?!" I ask out loud, to which The Boss nods so furiously it's a wonder he doesn't get concussion.</p><p>"WELL, I'll run the CD through the scanner then - just to be on the safe side."</p><p>The Boss's head movements change axis from a nod to a shake, whilst simultaneously nodding at The PFY.</p><p>"Oh, you want HIM to do it?" I ask, turning and tossing the CD to The PFY "Boss wants you to run this thro.."</p><p>>SLAM!<</p></p><p>"That's funny," The PFY comments. "I didn't hear a sonic boom, but I'm sure I should of."</p><p>"Should HAVE. And no - it must be the low wind resistance of polyester that saved us."</p><p>"So should I take the CD back."</p><p>"Not just yet, have to make a call or two!"</p><p>...</p><p>"..and bring the tranquiliser gun"</p><p>Ah mornings!</p><p>BOFH is copyright © 1995-2003, Simon Travaglia.
