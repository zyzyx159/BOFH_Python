            <h3>EPISODE 7 </h3>
            <br /><p></p><p>ORDINARILY, I am not one to counsel The Boss in times of mental torment. To be honest, I see my role more as a FACILITATOR of torment, but this time I'm going have to break my informal rules and find out what's upsetting him. This could be an unwise choice, but sometimes a good turn needs to be done, and it's obvious to all that The Boss is so far down in the mouth he's liable to swallow a shoe.</p><p>If it gets any worse The PFY will have to call the Vet - for humane reasons.</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>"What seems to be the problem?" I ask, with a due sense of trepidation.</p><p>"It's the Management meeting tomorrow afternoon," he confides unhappily.</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Well MAINLY the problem is that they're going to crucify me!" he snaps.</p><p>"Really? Why?"</p><p>"Were you not here the last week?"</p><p>"What do you mean exactly?"</p><p>"The helpdesk system - up and down like a whore's drawers!"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"They'll go berserk. Not to mention the performance of the new Asset Tracking Database that we'd outsourced as a project to that overseas firm in Karachi."</p><p>"The one that takes longer to find a match than a blind pyromaniac? Well I *DID* warn you about trusting a database whose design phase was over in 15 minutes..."</p><p>"Yes yes, but that doesn't bloody help me now!"</p><p>"True. But is that all that you're worried about - nothing else?"</p><p>"That's enough, isn't it?"</p><p>"Potato, Po-tah-to" I respond.</p><p>"What?!"</p><p>"You see a helpdesk system that only successfully logged two calls in 5 days, I see a fantastic reduction in the number of weekly unresolved calls!"</p><p>"I hardly think..."</p><p>"You see a database search engine that's so slow it needs a mobility scooter, I see a search engine which has completely eliminated false match reporting!"</p><p>"What, you want me to lie to them?"</p><p>"Lie to them? Good grief man, if 21st century world history has taught you anything, it must have taught you that 'What you don't know..."</p><p>"...can't hurt you', yes."</p><p>"Did you know that The PFY had removed the support bracket from your table last week?"</p><p>"No?"</p><p>"So that disproves that theory. What I was GOING to say was that 'What you don't know is an ideal marketing opportunity'."</p><p>"What ARE you talking about?"</p><p>"OK, you know last month when the Helpdesk coordinator told you that there'd been a huge reduction in reported sick leave in the previous four weeks?"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Yes, that was a euphemism for they'd stopped reporting it - but not taking it. Combine that with his next statements: 'dramatic reduction in helpdesk calls' and 'no service complaints logged' and you get?"</p><p>"There was no-one there most of the time?"</p><p>"Exactly."</p><p>"So what you're saying is that instead of reporting the truth.."</p><p>"INSTEAD of reporting the INCIDENTAL information, you should instead report the hidden benefits which may have otherwise have escaped observation, yes."</p><p>"So instead of saying that you and your assistant are homicidal megalomaniacs, I should say that you're..."</p><p>"Dedicated, Team-Playing professionals who will go the extra mile to get a job done properly, yes."</p><p>"And that Windows consultant I appointed last week to tighten up the company's IIS Server security... "</p><p>"Is a waste of good office space, yes."</p><p>"A waste- Where's the good side in that?"</p><p>"That was the good side."</p><p>"Oh. So my P.A., who can't type so good, or use an online calendar would be a People Person, putting people first?"</p><p>"Or, more geekily, a customer-focused professional, always willing to try the hands-on approach. Least that's what they say down at the pub."</p><p>"What?!"</p><p>"Nothing, just going that extra mile, like we always do.."</p><p>"Ah. OK. Well, I think I've got the hang of this now!" he burbles. "I think I'll just pop back to my office and browse some porn for the rest of the day!"</p><p>"Or, to put it another way..?"</p><p>"Uh... Keep myself abreast of the new and startling developments in the Web community to ensure my full exposure to the potential of the medium?"</p><p>"Couldn't have said it better myself."</p><p>"Yes I know, your assistant put it down for a 14 hour activity in last week's timesheets."</p><p>"He's a dedicated man," I admit.</p><p>The Boss toddles off happily, giving me time to set up some extended web-cache logging of his machine, which will 'accidentally' get emailled to the Head of IT at the end of the day..</p><p>"What are you up to?" The PFY asks, peering over my shoulder at the screen.</p><p>"Oh, just ensuring our exposure to a broad spectrum of Management resource with a wide variety of computing experience."</p><p>"Getting another Boss fired, right. Why?"</p><p>"He'd pretty much reached the pinnacle of his career."</p><p>"Oh, You told him about Operational Euphemisms then?"</p><p>"Exactly."</p><p>"It's a dirty business, this computing game"</p><p>"Indeed." ®</p><p>BOFH is copyright © 1995-2003, Simon Travaglia.
