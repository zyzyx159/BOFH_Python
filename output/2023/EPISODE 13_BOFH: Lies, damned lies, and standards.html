            <h3>EPISODE 13 </h3>
            <br /><p> "... but that's not the turnaround we promised our users!" the Boss bleats.</p><p>"But it is the recognized industry standard turnaround time," I counter.</p><p>"Which industry standard is that?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"The one set by the Association of Servicepeople for Software and Hardware Over the Lifetime of Equipment."</p><p>"What association is that?"</p><p>"A set of industry professionals," I respond.</p><p>"And this is an accredited body?"</p><p>"Absolutely! It's a self-regulating industry group."</p><p>"And they produce industry standards?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"Of course! Who's more likely to comprehend industry requirements than people actively working in the industry? I mean, if you were to set a benchmark – as you have done – how do you know that's even achievable?"</p><p>"I ..."</p><p>"No, industry bodies have a long and proud history of setting standards, listening to complaints, finding the guilty party and having absolutely no hesitation in fining them several pounds."</p><p>"Several thousand pounds, surely?"</p><p>"No, no. The real punishment is a censure from an industry body. The fine is just to cover administration costs."</p><p>"And those administration costs vary over time I presume?" the Boss asks drily.</p><p>"No, they're linked to a monetary standard."</p><p>"The cost of a pint?" the Boss suggests.</p><p>"Two pints, I think you'll find," the PFY says, entering Mission Control. "It's much stabler."</p><p>"Stabler than what?"</p><p>"Two pints and a couple of packets of pork scratchings," I reply. "There was some instability during the swine flu epidemic and, as neither the PFY nor myself actually liked pork scratchings, we acted quickly to stabilize the currency, as it were."</p><p>"So the industry body is just you two?"</p><p>"Yes. But as a body we've grown 100 percent in the past year."</p><p>"So it was originally just you?" the Boss asks me.</p><p>"Sure, but at our current rate of growth we'll have doubled our members by the end of the year."</p><p>"And what qualifications do you have to be an industry body?"</p><p>"Oh, the same rigorous standards as are required to become a nutritionist."</p><p>"Yes, but you're not a nutritionist."</p><p>"I am! I pioneered the toner-cartridge diet."</p><p>"The what?"</p><p>"The toner cartridge diet. You eat old toner cartridges. I can guarantee you'll lose weight."</p><p>"And help save the planet," the PFY says. "For around three months."</p><p>"That's how long the toner cartridge diet lasts, is it?"</p><p>"That's one way of looking at it. In any case, I see a lot of people needing nutrition advice in my other role as a personal trainer."</p><p>"Another job with no real certification?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"But I am certified," I counter.</p><p>"By the Association of Personal Trainers Over the Lifetime of the Trainee?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"The Association of Personal Trainers and Nutritionists," I reply.</p><p>"... over the life of the trainee," the PFY adds.</p><p>"A life which is often unnaturally short?" the Boss counters.</p><p>"The industry is still reviewing the data to determine any causal relationships," the PFY says. "There are a lot of gray areas."</p><p>"But we do expect a result any time in the next three to four years," I add.</p><p>"Meantime your clients lose weight from toner cartridge poisoning?"</p><p>"Surprisingly no. No, most of my clients usually quit the diet due to injuries sustained in their training regime."</p><p>"The 100m traffic sprints appear to have particularly high attrition rates," the PFY admits.</p><p>"And you're reviewing that 'for causal relationships' I assume?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"Indeed, we are. We have a number of trials on the go at the moment. In fact, we recently ran a couple of double-blind tests," I say proudly.</p><p>"Which proved?"</p><p>"That two blindfolds do not increase safety in traffic sprints. Though as we discovered – running with the traffic, instead of against it, does."</p><p>"The scientific method proves itself once again," the PFY nods. "We're always learning."</p><p>"And how did you become a... nutritionist and personal trainer?"</p><p>"Oh, it came up in a discussion with my holistic healing guru."</p><p>"I take it that means you?" the Boss asks the PFY.</p><p>"It does," the PFY says happily.</p><p>"And you're a member of the association of... whatever... over the life of the client?"</p><p>"I am indeed."</p><p>"So what's holistic healing got to do with recommending people career advice?"</p><p>"I like to look at my clients as a whole in order to determine the best journey to fulfill their purpose. The holistic experience is one of finding the collective alignment of the person's chakra with the chi."</p><p>To be fair, I'd thought the crap the PFY and I had been talking had already taken us to the porkies event horizon, but I think the PFY may have just thrust us over the edge. Too many lies in a confined reality can distort the truth to such a point that it bends the minds of lesser mortals.</p><p>...</p><p>"Who's up for some traffic sprints?" I ask 30 seconds later.</p><p>The Boss, PFY and myself put our hands up.</p><p>"I'll get the blindfolds!" the PFY chuckles crazily.</p>
