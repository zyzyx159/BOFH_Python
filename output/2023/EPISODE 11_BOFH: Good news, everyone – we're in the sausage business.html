            <h3>EPISODE 11 </h3>
            <br /><p> "Just after your thoughts on office automation?" the Boss says, having recently returned from a "Think Tank for the Future" meeting between him and the Director.</p><p>The two of them.</p><p>No one else.</p><p>A meeting of the Brains Trust – a team whose "future vision" extends from now till dinnertime.</p><p>"Great stuff," the PFY says, nodding. "Paperless office, streamlined work processes, redundancies and ultimately a smaller workforce?"</p><p>"Uh no," the Boss backpedals.</p><p>"Right, so scope change to current workplace methodology, advanced workplace devices like printers that collate, staple, label and dispatch, resulting in, uh, redundancies and a smaller workforce?"</p><p>"No?"</p><p>"Well, that just leaves AI, advanced robotics, Rise of the Machines, and uh … smaller workforce."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Then you've lost me."</p><p>"We don't want to reduce the workforce; we want to make better use of them."</p><p>"In that case I'd suggest opening a sausage factory," the PFY responds.</p><p>"Can you talk to him?" the Boss asks, turning to me.</p><p>"Of course I can," I blurt. "I do it all the time. Though in his case I'd have led with the whole 'Rise of the Machines' theme."</p><p>"We just want to make better use of people," the Boss says.</p><p>"So the 'sausage factory' idea's definitely a no-go then?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"We want a way of cutting the monotony out of people's lives so that they can focus on other things," the Boss says, ignoring the PFY once more.</p><p>"This meeting would seem like a great place to start," the PFY chips in.</p><p>"What are you suggesting?" I ask.</p><p>"OK, what about lighting? Do you know how much time people waste every day just turning lights on and off?"</p><p>"Ballpark? Say maybe 100 separate office spaces, maybe two seconds per switch, 200 seconds."</p><p>"And that's just turning them on!" the Boss says excitedly.</p><p>"So … we're talking about … rounded up, seven minutes a day?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Yes, but EVERY DAY!" the Boss blurts.</p><p>"What's that … less than 30 hours a year?" I ask.</p><p>"Precisely!"</p><p>"You could save more people-time by just getting the cleaners to unstick the ends of new toilet rolls," the PFY says.</p><p>"We're looking for things that AI can do," the Boss says.</p><p>"This conversation for a start."</p><p>"No, because it wouldn't have come up with the lighting idea!" the Boss counters.</p><p>"It certainly wouldn't – because of the I in AI. Though I'm pretty sure it could have held up my side of this conversation, though."</p><p>"Look, we need to find some things for AI to do."</p><p>"Why?" I ask. "You've not gone and bought something have you?"</p><p>"I … we … signed up for a large amount of AI," the Boss says, suggesting that AI arrives in boxes off the back of a lorry. "It's the future."</p><p>"What are we talking – several thousand gigaspandrels?" I ask.</p><p>"Probably," the Boss says, having no idea what I'm talking about.</p><p>"Well," the PFY jumps in, "if we've got thousands of gigaspandrels, I hope you've at least signed up for a couple of tetrabytes of Mu-RAM, because we've got nothing remotely that fast on any of our servers – we're just using traditional hardware, and none of that emerging technology."</p><p>"I didn't go into the details," the Boss says, "but it's all outlined here – maybe you can suggest some ways we might be able to make it help the company out?"</p><p>Sure enough, the Boss has authorized a "subscription" to a nebulously defined SaaS AI platform which probably doesn't exist. The contract has more holes than a mechanic's underpants so I call the least larcenous of the Company's legal people and suggest he contact the AI company concerned and use the legal version of words like gigaspandrels and Mu-RAM while implying there's a new law about AI hate crime and targeting the mentally deficient. Within half an hour he calls back to inform me that the whole contract is just a misunderstanding and a thing of the past.</p><p>"Yes, but how we will use AI?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"We don't need to use any AI. We only needed it because you paid for it."</p><p>"Yes, but could we use it?"</p><p>"What for?"</p><p>"TO MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES BETTER."</p><p>"You'll need to clarify what you mean by better. If we're talking about the day-to-day monotony of endless conversations about how AI is going to replace us all with more intelligent versions of ourselves then that sausage factory idea is getting my vote."</p><p>"AI will likely replace us with better versions of ourselves."</p><p>"Yes, but in some cases the 'intelligence bar' is set Olympics-Limbo level low," the PFY counters, "and the people concerned were probably already locked in a battle for intellectual supremacy with the office house plants."</p><p>"Yes, but we need to show we're a company of the future!" the Boss insists. "We can't afford to be left behind while the rest of the world advances!"</p><p>"And this is a company policy?" I ask.</p><p>"It's come direct from the Board!"</p><p>"We could just contract a small company that has some strong links with AI," the PFY suggests. "Then we could say we're heavily into AI without having to actually do anything too drastic."</p><p>"Is it possible?"</p><p>"I'll check and get back to you."</p><p>… TWO DAYS LATER …</p><p>"How's that contract with the AI company coming along?" the Boss asks excitedly.</p><p>"They've countersigned and couriered it back," the PFY says, with a similar level of excitement, tearing open the courier pouch on his desk. "We're now in the sausage business!"</p><p>"What?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"AI. Artificial Intestine – the casings for sausages. Surely you read the contract. They're market leaders – and all developed not five miles from here."</p><p>"What!?"</p><p>"It's a sausage factory. Like we discussed."</p><p>"I didn't bloody discuss a sausage factory!"</p><p>"Sure we did. You paid for 20,000 conversion sessions."</p><p>"I paid for 20,000 CONVERSATION sessions. What the hell's a conversion session?"</p><p>"You know, when the animal goes in the back and sausages come out the front."</p><p>"WHAT!? I didn't sign up for that."</p><p>"You did," I reply.</p><p>"We need to cancel that contract!" the Boss says.</p><p>"I think I'll leave that to you. One pointer, though …"</p><p>"WHAT?"</p><p>"When you go to see them, don't use the back door."</p>
