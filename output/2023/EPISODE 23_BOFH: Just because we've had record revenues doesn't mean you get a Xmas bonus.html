            <h1>BOFH: Just because we've had record revenues doesn't mean you get a Xmas bonus </h1> 
            <h2>Are you sure you don't want to rethink that, though, Boss? </h2>
            <h3>EPISODE 23 </h3>
            <br /><p> NOW IS THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT!</p><p>Yes, it's Christmas Bonus time once again and the cupboard is most certainly bare – not because the company is doing appallingly, but because the directors of the company have decided that they want the bonus money to be given to the less-well-off in our society – via the trickle down method. In other words, they're keeping the money for themselves as a thank you for steering the company through the post-COVID years, after banking record revenues through the pandemic.</p><p>Ordinarily this sort of news is only reported at the company Christmas party – however, the board decided to soften the blow by telling us early. And cancelling the Christmas Party – to cut costs … which will no doubt result in a fractionally higher bonus.</p><p>AH, GOOD TIMES!</p><p>The PFY is not impressed, as the company's done remarkably well in the last few years so he'd assumed bonuses would be back on the cards. </p><p>The Boss is similarly gloomy.</p><p>I, on the other hand, am more pragmatic. If the money's there to be taken, the board will take it.</p><p>The PFY has a mathematical approach to this disappointment: fewer board members would result in a surplus of cash, which would then be available for bonuses.</p><p>"Ah, your carefree optimism!" I cry. "At the board level, this would just mean an increase in bonus for the remaining members."</p><p>"You're taking this rather well," the Boss opines.</p><p>"Yes, I think it was George Santayana who said 'Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to spend hours in a fake escape room in the basement with only a pencil, a bucket of partially drinkable water and a single sheet of toilet paper'."</p><p>"But … no toilet?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Well there's that bucket."</p><p>"What, you're serious?" the Boss gasps.</p><p>"Oh yes. They went in 40 minutes ago."</p><p>"They wouldn't be stupid enough to do that."</p><p>"Sure they would – they got an email telling them that the bonus was being paid in cash to get around tiresome VAT rules and that we made it a 'competition' so they could declare it as winnings from a game of skill – if they declared it at all. They couldn't get here quick enough!"</p><p>"So you're holding them prisoner?"</p><p>"I'm not sure they're aware of that yet. One of them isolated the sprinkler supply to the building because he thought it was a key to opening the door."</p><p>"And what are they doing now?"</p><p>"I don't know, I turned the lights off about ten minutes ago and they've been using their phone LEDs for lighting. And apparently the mobile coverage in the plant room is appalling."</p><p>"Turn the lights on will you?" the Boss asks.</p><p>…</p><p>"Hello?" one of the crustier board members pleads into the void.</p><p>"Hello," I reply. "How are you doing?"</p><p>"We seem to be having problems finding the first … uh … clue."</p><p>"Ah yes!" I respond "The first clue. And you're sure you've looked?"</p><p>"Yes. I think perhaps this game is not really for us."</p><p>"I understand. You realize, however, that the form you signed earlier says you forfeit your bonus if you fail to win the game of skill?"</p><p>"Ah. Are there any hints you can give us?"</p><p>"Of course there are, and I'm only too pleased to help!"</p><p>"How many clues are there?"</p><p>"How many living people are in the room?"</p><p>"What?! Uhm, seven."</p><p>"Not eight?"</p><p>"No, Sir Nigel passed away last night."</p><p>"That's terrible news. No doubt you've cast lots for his bonus?"</p><p>"Pardon?"</p><p>"Nothing, just a semi-seasonal reference. So, as noted on the form you are each entitled to one clue."</p><p>"OK, can I have my clue?"</p><p>"Sure. You'll notice that the red fire evacuation notice to your left is held to the wall with a single screw, allowing you to swing the sign to one side."</p><p>From my display, the PFY, Boss and I listen to the discussion several floors below.</p><p>"It's a credit card reader! Is there anything written on it? Does it have a serial number that's a code of some sort? What happens if you push the buttons?"</p><p>…</p><p>"I think we'll need another clue," the board member groans, about five minutes of prodding and discussion later.</p><p>"But you haven't activated your first clue!" I blurt.</p><p>"How do we activate the first clue?"</p><p>"I'm so glad you asked. You see in front of you a credit card reader …"</p><p>"What, we have to pay?" he snaps back, offended.</p><p>"Not at all. I can assure you that you will exit this room in six hours whether you pay or not."</p><p>"Well we'll do that then."</p><p>"I can also assure you that the huge lump in the middle of the floor – known in the trade as a scour valve – will open 12 times in that period."</p><p>"What's a scour valve?"</p><p>"I'll give you a free clue. There's a really large sewer pipe connected to it, with the pressurized waste from the building passing through it."</p><p>"So we have to pay?"</p><p>"Yes, but I can assure you that you will be pleased you paid for this hint."</p><p>"How much is it?"</p><p>"The number will appear on the screen."</p><p>"A hundred and eighty pounds," he gasps.</p><p>"It'll be worth it!" I say.</p><p>*kaching*</p><p>"Alright, what's my clue?"</p><p>"Your clue is a three-parter. (1) You've just paid for one item for the company Christmas Party; (2) The items get more expensive with each clue; and (3) Your credit card was disabled after the transaction and cannot be reused for another transaction."</p><p>I let that sink in for a moment.</p><p>"Can I buy a clue?" one of the sharper member asks.</p><p>"Indeed you can!"</p><p>"Two hundred and forty five pounds!"</p><p>"That'll be the champagne."</p><p>*kaching*</p><p>"I'll buy a clue!" another member says, seeing where this is going.</p><p>…</p><p>"Three hundred and seventeen pounds."</p><p>"And that's the lagers," I comment.</p><p>… three transactions later …</p><p>"Two thousand, six hundred and eighty pounds!"</p><p>"The catering. I did warn you the items were increasingly expensive."</p><p>"I'm not paying! I don't care if you open that valve thing!"</p><p>"BONUS CLUES TIME!" I burble. "These are for everyone. Clue 1. As I noted earlier, the number of clues required is linked to the number of people alive in the room; Clue 2. Your Christmas Bonuses are, no doubt, only given to board members who are alive; and Clue 3. There are several bricks laying in the corner of the room."</p><p>"I'LL PAY!" our recalcitrant board member cries, microseconds later.</p><p>*kaching*</p><p>"CONGRATULATIONS!" I gasp happily. "You have successfully negotiated your way out of the escape room."</p><p>"The door's still closed."</p><p>"Well yes, like I told you, the door will open in six hours. The Christmas Party starts four hours from now."</p><p>"But you've sorted out the scour valve thingy?"</p><p>"Why would you think that?"</p><p>"But we paid!"</p><p>"Oh yes. For the party. But perhaps we should talk about staff bonuses."</p><p>"That's non-negotiable."</p><p>"No problems. I'm just going to vent the scour valve – just to clear any trapped gas. You can use that time to think about that bonus situation …"</p>
