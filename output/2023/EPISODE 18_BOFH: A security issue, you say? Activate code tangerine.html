            <br /><p> "Someone keeps submitting an unfit response," the Boss sniffles in response to a question I wish I'd never asked about his feedback survey.</p><p>"Really?" the PFY says. "How?"</p><p>"Mostly they paste that Lorem Ipsum stuff and then on the last question they attach a picture of crudely drawn male genitals."</p><p>"The … meat and two veg?" I ask.</p><p>"I …" the Boss starts, before petering out.</p><p>"Was it in answer to the question about their impression of senior management?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Their feelings about IT department?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"The person who put the survey together?"</p><p>"LOOK, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT QUESTION IT WAS IN ANSWER TO!"</p><p>Paydirt!</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"So which of you did it?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"Uh … neither of us," I reply with a fair amount of certainty.</p><p>"So who was it?" the Boss snaps.</p><p>"No idea. You made us make the form anonymous to get honest responses."</p><p>"Yes, but you could look …"</p><p>"It's anonymous!" the PFY responds.</p><p>"Yes, but surely the form would have … debugging information?" he wheedles.</p><p>"Sure, but I'm conflicted. Wouldn't that be … an abuse of my administrative privileges?" the PFY asks.</p><p>This from a man who'd routinely shut down the network comms to the vending machine on the ground floor so that he could get a free biscuit from the machine owner for helping to "diagnose the fault."</p><p>"It just seems … wrong," he adds.</p><p>A man who – more than once – glued a tinfoil cutout of a pistol between the pages of the Boss's journal when he knew he had an upcoming flight.</p><p>"I'm not sure we should break that chain of privacy …" the PFY adds.</p><p>From the man for whom no mailbox is safe.</p><p>"Look, given the nature of these pictures, it could be … a … security issue," the Boss says, drawing the long bow.</p><p>"So it's a code tangerine then?" I ask.</p><p>"A code tangerine?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"A code tangerine," I nod. "Triggered by the words SECURITY ISSUE. We also respond to the words HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE, PUBLIC LIABILITY ISSUE, and CODE FIFTY-FIVE FIFTY-FIVE."</p><p>"CODE FIFTY-FIVE FIFTY-FIVE?"</p><p>"Yeah, but that's an old code from when the head of security used to have a stutter. By the time he got that out you either knew he was serious or the incident was over."</p><p>"I mean, because they might …"</p><p>"NO NEED TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF! All I needed was the words SECURITY ISSUE. We can do anything we like if it's a security issue. We can isolate someone in a darkened lift between floors for several hours if there's a threat to human safety!"</p><p>"I … didn't say anything about there being a threat."</p><p>"It was implied," I counter. "After all, what if he sent these poorly sketched anatomy pictures to just anyone? Maybe they'd have a heart attack?! That's safety right there!"</p><p>"I hardly think …"</p><p>"What about if he or she sent them to a vegetarian!!?!" the PFY suggests.</p><p>"Or a vegan!" I add.</p><p>I have no idea where we're going with this, but I have to admit I'm getting a little swept up in the hyperbole.</p><p>"Look, I just want to get to the bottom of this. Perhaps it's some form of mistake."</p><p>"Yes, I see what you mean," the PFY says. "I was filling out your survey and – repeatedly – accidentally attached a hand-sketched image of genitalia which I just happened to have on my work machine. That sort of thing?"</p><p>"You did say 'KEEPS' submitting," I add. "So it's ongoing. Trying to make a point."</p><p>"What if they're some form of … terrorist?" the PFY suggests.</p><p>"Should we call the police?" I gasp.</p><p>"WHAT!? No, of course not! It's just someone having a bit of fun at my expense."</p><p>"So … it's NOT a security issue?" I say, feigning disappointment.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"And we … won't need to implement code tangerine?" the PFY sighs.</p><p>"I don't think that's really necessary."</p><p>"And you're OK with not finding out who keeps sending that to you?"</p><p>"I think it's not worth the potential issues it might cause. I think we should maybe close the feedback form down," the Boss grudges, grudgingly.</p><p>"No problems." >Clickety< "No sooner said than down!" the PFY says.</p><p>…</p><p>The Boss wanders off to bury his disappointment under several layers of biscuits from the vending machine on the ground floor and the PFY looks up from his screen.</p><p>"So I can remove the feedback survey QR code from the pub toilet wall then?"</p><p>"I think it would be best. Once again the Boss has raised an issue which isn't an issue."</p><p>"You know …" the PFY begins, "they say that repeatedly reporting false alarms can lead to workplace complacency. And complacency can lead to?"</p><p>"Workplace safety issues," I reply. "And you know that some might even say it's a security issue …"</p><p>"CODE TANGERINE!" the PFY says, hitting the lift stop button.</p><p>It looks like the Boss will be waiting several hours for those biscuits.</p>
