            <h3>EPISODE 8 </h3>
            <br /><p> So I'm digging around in the Pit of Despair - ie, the IT Storeroom, when the Boss wanders in, having no doubt been drawn in by the tractor-beam of obsolescence.</p><p>"Look!" he says, pointing at a chunk of off-silver on a shelf. "Is that an M1330?"</p><p>"An old laptop," I say.</p><p>"Yes!" he gasps, pulling it down from the shelf. "I used to have one of these when I worked for BT."</p><p>"20 quid and it's yours!" I say.</p><p>"20 quid?"</p><p>"Yeah, it's still here because it has a book value, like all the other junk in this room. "</p><p>I take a quick look at the underside of the machine.</p><p>"Oooooh, Blue inventory label – it was purchased between 2005 and 2009 – The bad years."</p><p>"Bad years?"</p><p>"We had a Head Beancounter who revalued our IT assets upwards then lowered the depreciation rate – presumably because some bonus depended on it. Later, when we tried to change it back, the auditors raised some harsh tax implication."</p><p>"And what did our Head Accountant say?"</p><p>"Oh, he'd left the company by that stage."</p><p>"Ah."</p><p>"In an ambulance, as it happens."</p><p>"I... so I could write this off?" the Boss asks covetously.</p><p>"You could – but remember those tax implications. Buying it from the company for a nominal fee allows the company to write down the value and recognize the true value as a sold asset."</p><p>I have no idea what I just said, but the Boss swallows it.</p><p>"How do I do that?" he asks.</p><p>"I'll ask around," I say, putting the laptop back and herding the Boss to the door. "I'll get back to you in around half an hour."</p><p>The only person I'll be asking is the PFY and he'll be wanting his 50 percent share – or 5 quid after my conveyance fees.</p><p>"There's a big market for old computers and componentry," the PFY says "Slap the word 'retro' or 'steampunk' on your eBay listing and the saddos will be all over it like a rash."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Oh yeah," he said. "People love to relive their glory years. There's a guy I know who has a simh VAX-11/780 purely to finish playing the game of dungeon he started 25 years ago."</p><p>"I WILL NOT BE BEATEN!" I snap back.</p><p>...</p><p>"And that'll be 20 quid," I say to the Boss, handing the machine over.</p><p>Money changes hands and the Boss turns to leave...</p><p>"Is that... a PS/1 Consultant!?" he asks.</p><p>"What, this old thing?" I ask, "accidentally" nudging the case around so the Boss can see the back.</p><p>"It's got a SoundBlaster card and the CD!!!" he gasps, in danger of wetting himself.</p><p>"If you say so."</p><p>"Is it..."</p><p>"On the asset register?" I ask "Yeah, someone bought 10 of them to trial work-from-home in the mid '90s. It was such a success we ended up with 10 of these in the storeroom about six months later."</p><p>"YOU'VE GOT 10 OF THEM!!!!!?"</p><p>"10 of the base units, yes, but only two monitors."</p><p>"What happened to the others?"</p><p>"Oh, they were responsibly disposed of."</p><p>"Oh," the Boss sighs.</p><p>"Yeah, we stacked them on a trailer, then kept accelerating around the Elephant and Castle roundabout till the trailer was empty."</p><p>"That doesn't sound... responsible."</p><p>"Things were much simpler back then - 'Environmental Responsibility' meant not dumping them in the same place as we dumped the Data Generals."</p><p>"Where was that?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"In the Thames. And we only dumped a couple. But then we stopped doing that."</p><p>"Good."</p><p>"Yes. They managed to refloat the ferry, but it never steered straight after that."</p><p>"That was so dangerous. Didn't you take any precautions?!"</p><p>"Of course. We drilled the serial number tags off before we left the office," I say. "Anyway, you want this PC or what?"</p><p>"How much?"</p><p>"I could let you have it for... let's see..."</p><p>I tap away at my phone like I've got a calculator app running.</p><p>"120."</p><p>"A hundred and twenty quid!" the Boss gasps.</p><p>"Well, 117, but I rounded up."</p><p>"I'll give you... 95."</p><p>"Can I phone a friend?" I ask.</p><p>"Take it or leave it," the Boss says, playing hardball.</p><p>"I guess I'll take it," I say, as the Boss hands over more cash from his overstuffed wallet.</p><p>I move the machine over towards him, which reveals...</p><p>"IS THAT A COMMODORE CBM?!" he gasps once more. "WITH THE DUAL FLOPPY DRIVE!!!"</p><p>One estimate of the remaining cash in the Boss' wallet later, he's leaving the pit of despair with a trolley load of ancient computing gear – with no recollection of the conversation he had with the Director two weeks ago when they talked about their favourite computers of all time.</p><p>I shunt some "Thames-quality" hardware around so that my next 'shuffling' will 'accidentally' bring to light a TRS 80 Model 100, an Apple Lisa, and a Dayglo iMac G3.</p><p>Now it's just a waiting game till the tractor-beam inevitably pulls our Director in.</p><p>I make myself look busy in the meantime...</p>
