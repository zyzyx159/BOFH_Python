            <h3>EPISODE 2 </h3>
            <br /><p> "Just need a little hand in the meeting room," our Director says, popping his head around the door to Mission Control.</p><p>"There's something wrong with the screen."</p><p>"Really?" the PFY lies. "I was just using it half an hour ago."</p><p>He wasn't, but there's never anything wrong with the screen.</p><p>...</p><p>"Right, so the screen is on >press<  HDMI, and... you're not plugged into the HDMI cable," I say.</p><p>"No, I was using the wireless connection," he chips back.</p><p>"So... it stopped working?" I ask.</p><p>"No, I mean I wanted to use the wireless connection."</p><p>"Okay, so you set the screen to Screen Share  >press<   >press<, like so?"</p><p>"How did you do that?" the Director asks.</p><p>"I pressed the source button twice. Like it says on the note on the wall."</p><p>"Oh, is that about the screen? I thought it was about connecting to the meeting room wireless."</p><p>"Are you connected to the meeting room wireless?" I ask.</p><p>"I suppose so."</p><p>"Have you checked?"</p><p>"Isn't it automatic?"</p><p>"It's automatic – unless you use the office wireless – in which case it won't automatically change over."</p><p>"How do you check again?" he asks.</p><p>...</p><p>This is my life now.</p><p>I mean I'm hardly at the "attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion" point of my existence, but I am starting to question some of my life choices.</p><p>Before I can show him how to find the wireless settings, AGAIN, his laptop turns itself off with a critical battery level.</p><p>...</p><p>"Have you got a charger?" he asks.</p><p>I think quickly about the cupboard full of chargers in the storeroom.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"So how will I give my presentation?"</p><p>"Is it on a USB stick?"</p><p>"No..."</p><p>"Well..."</p><p>An hour later a laptop charger is dropped off by one of the Director's grumpier offspring and he's back in business. Some hasty wireless changes and screen sharing ensues.</p><p>"Now I just need this screen to show on the big screen," he says.</p><p>"It... is showing," I point out.</p><p>"No, I mean THAT screen," he says, pointing at a small picture of a screen on his PowerPoint slide.</p><p>"That's a picture of a screen – inside a PowerPoint slide."</p><p>"Yes, I want that on the big screen."</p><p>"Then you should have a slide which only has a picture of the screen on it."</p><p>"So I can't have it?"</p><p>"You can if you edit the slide?"</p><p>"I don't have time to edit the slide, the meeting's starting!"</p><p>...two minutes later...</p><p>"What meeting?" I ask.</p><p>"The Zoom meeting. I'm just waiting for the call."</p><p>"Is Zoom running on your machine?" I ask.</p><p>"No, no, I want it to run on the screen."</p><p>"It's... just a screen. You need to run Zoom on your machine and mirror it to the screen if you want it on the screen."</p><p>"No, because I'm running PowerPoint on my machine."</p><p>"You can do both. You run Zoom and share your screen."</p><p>"I don't have Zoom installed."</p><p>"Sure you do, we rolled it out over COVID."</p><p>"Yes but I deleted it after the lockdowns. Can't they just call the screen?"</p><p>"That screen is just a screen.  It doesn't have any smarts – no camera, no microphone."</p><p>"Someone had video conferencing on it last week!"</p><p>"From their laptop. Over wireless screen share. Using Zoom."</p><p>"So I can't join the meeting?"</p><p>"No," I say, as the red mist threatens to descend.</p><p>"Can I use your laptop?"</p><p>"It's got Kali Linux on it."</p><p>"I don't know what that means."</p><p>"It means you can't use my laptop."</p><p>"Wait, I've got Zoom on my phone!" he gasps.</p><p>He fires up Zoom and waits patiently.</p><p>...two minutes later...</p><p>"No Meeting?" I ask.</p><p>"They should have called by now," he whines.</p><p>"Who set the meeting up?"</p><p>"I did."</p><p>"So maybe you should be calling them then?"</p><p>"No, it's in the meeting notes," he says, pointing to an email on his laptop.</p><p>"This is an UNSENT meeting email – for a TEAMS meeting. For this time last year. And you haven't put any attendees in it."</p><p>"I couldn't send the meeting request!" the Director complains.</p><p>"Because it was scheduled for last year."</p><p>"So I've missed the meeting?" he asks.</p><p>"THERE WAS NO MEETING! YOU DIDN'T SEND AN INVITE!"</p><p>"Oh. So I should close Zoom?"</p><p>"IT WAS NEVER GOING TO BE ON ZOOM!"</p><p>...</p><p>"So I guess I just have to organize the meeting in person then?"</p><p>"I suppose so."</p><p>"OK then. How are you and Steven placed for later this morning?"</p><p>"Wait! What – you were meeting with us?!"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"You were in our office two hours ago! You could have met with us in person then!"</p><p>"Yes, but I wanted to see my PowerPoint slide on the big screen."</p><p>I make an mental note to change our meeting rooms so they have external windows.  Meantime I'll have to improvise.</p><p>...</p><p>"...and then the projector fell on his head," I tell the HR Health and Safety person after the ambulance has gone.</p><p>"Why would he be using a projector when you have that big screen?" the H&S bloke asks.</p><p>"Oh, there's something wrong with the screen," the PFY says. "He reported that to us earlier today."</p><p>"It looks fine," the HR bloke says, switching the screen on.</p><p>"I have a cupboard full of old projectors," I warn him. "Some of them are much heavier than that one..."</p><p>Case closed.</p>
