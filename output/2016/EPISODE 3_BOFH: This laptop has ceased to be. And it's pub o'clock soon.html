            <h3>EPISODE 3 </h3>
            <br /><p></p><p>You know what it's like. The Boss asks you some technical question, you give him a non-technical answer and he suddenly thinks you're lying to him – or worse – that you don't know what you're talking about.</p><p>He needs it explained to him in a manner that sounds technical, but isn't too technical for him to stack overflow. ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON.</p><p>Today it's our website.</p><p>"So how secure is it?" he asks pointedly</p><p>"A WordPress site?" I ask "Configured with every plugin under the sun? Loosely 'administered' by the PR team? Hosted on a cloud server in who-knows-where, chosen with the same care and attention you'd use in picking a toilet to use after seven pints and a bad curry and a half hour tube ride which only gets you half-way home."</p><p>"So it's not secure?"</p><p>"Never updated, never vetted, protected by what's probably a one-bit self signed SSL key?"</p><p>"So it IS secure?" he asks</p><p>"With content that was just sucked out of our old web server and sports massaged into the new server by someone who left their A-Z of IT night course just before C, when Butchery came up?"</p><p>"So it's not secure?"</p><p>"Nah, it's safe as houses," I say.</p><p>The Boss has his sarcasm-proof hearing aids in so I'll have to spell it out plainly.</p><p>"It's insecure," I say.</p><p>"How insecure are we talking?"</p><p>"It is so insecure that the hosting company remirrors it every hour."</p><p>"So... it takes an hour to be compromised?" he asks, using a word he must have recently heard at an IT Manager's round table somewhere.</p><p>"No, it takes about 30 seconds to compromise, but on average it takes about an hour for the robots to find it." I reply.</p><p>"Well what are the vulnerabilities?" he asks – again with the technical words. (It's possible he's had a stack upgrade somewhere along the line)</p><p>"I could tell you – but the quantum rule of insecurity applies."</p><p>"The what?"</p><p>"The quantum rule of insecurity – which states that the act of observing how vulnerable a host or service is changes the insecurity level of the service. Have you not heard of Schrödinger's Laptop?"</p><p>"Schrödinger's Laptop?"</p><p>"There's a laptop, in a box, with a bomb. The bomb is actually timed to explode at some unknown time in the future – BUT if you lift the lid there's a switch connected to the lid which will make the bomb go off immediately. So the question is, is the laptop working or not?</p><p>"Is it powered on? Is it open?" the Boss asks, like a helpdesk savant.</p><p>"You're missing the point – the point is that you might not KNOW if the laptop was working or not, but as soon as you open the lid it will DEFINITELY not be working.</p><p>"So... you're saying that... the laptop might have... different... states... than just working or not working."</p><p>"Who cares, it's not my laptop," I reply. "And it's not my webserver either. We told them to get a reputable hosting company if they put it on the cloud and they just clicked on the first thing that came up in their Google search."</p><p>"I see. So back to this laptop –" the Boss says, breaking out a small sweat as the CPU cranks up "– are you saying that it could be considered to be alive, dead, neither … or both?"</p><p>"Oh it's dead." I say. "It's got Windows 8 on it."</p><p>"But you don't KNOW it's dead. And anyway, my home laptop has Windows 8 on it – nothing wrong with it!"</p><p>"Knowing isn't the point – But we all know 8's a machine killer. "</p><p>"But the only way you could be 100 per cent sure is by opening the lid!" he says</p><p>"IT'S RUNNING WINDOWS 8!" I say "Of course it's dead. Anyway, I wouldn't open the box, I'd just tell security that someone left them a vintage slab of Tennents Extra for helping them to push start their car."</p><p>"But what if they haven't help push start a car?"</p><p>"Trust me, the only thing OUR security would push start is the ciggy lighter in their car or the call button at a drive-thru deep fry house. And besides, the words 'Tennents Extra' ring in their ears so loudly the tinnitus will block the rest of the sentence out."</p><p>"So you'd maim a security guard just to prove a point?"</p><p>"It's one of OUR security guards! They gain a stone a year, have a three figure BMI and an average life expectancy of 27! I'd be doing them a favour!"</p><p>"So how do we make our website secure – as it sounds like we don't host it?"</p><p>"You're right we don't. But there are some simple steps we generally take to secure a rogue service hosted in the cloud."</p><p>"Yes?" "Well first we find the ACTUAL cloud site that is hosting the service – in this case a web site."</p><p>"...and get a consultant in to patch it and run penetration testing?" the Boss says, with more technical words than he knows what to do with.</p><p>"No. Generally we get a work van, a brick, and three or four large drums of petrol with the filler caps removed..."</p><p>...</p><p>The Boss finally realises the futility of trying to engage me in technical conversation in pub-countdown time and wanders off to his office.</p><p>The PFY is just about to say something to me when there's a medium >crump< sound from outside the office.</p><p>"Schrödinger's Laptop?" he asks.</p><p>"It's an ex Laptop."</p><p>"It has ceased to be," the PFY nods.</p>
