            <h3>EPISODE 2 </h3>
            <br /><p></p><p>So I'm sitting in Mission Control when The Boss bowls in with a complaint about some advice I'd given a geek from the helldesk last week.</p><p>"He says the motherboard/processor/memory combo you told him to buy is crap!" he mutters.</p><p>"What, the Gigabyte/Athlon/DDR?" I enquire, wondering what sort of paint thinner he's been tipping on his breakfast cereal. "True, it's not THE fastest processor out, but the price performance makes it a sure winner!"</p><p>"He says it's slow," The Boss whines, starting to get on my tits.</p><p>"How slow are we talking - as slow as the Microsoft software registration process?"</p><p>"I don't know - he says it's as slow as his original machine!"</p><p>"A PII with 32 Megs of memory? I hardly think so!"</p><p>"He claims you deliberately recommended a crap box to him!!"</p><p>"Bollocks! What operating system is he running?"</p><p>"Ah... Windows X.P"</p><p>"Ah yes. Not so much resource hungry as resource addicted. But still - what hardware's in it?"</p><p>"I don't know! Here's his configuration page - you see if you can work it out."</p><p>The Boss passes over a page of paper that looks to be the output of some generic system config utility, and I give it the old fisheye. Most disturbing is the handwritten note at the bottom 'and PCI/ISA Bridge'.</p><p>"What's that?" I ask, pointing to the note.</p><p>"Something your assistant recommended so that he could reuse his old disks and stuff to keep the total price down apparently."</p><p>"Did you also ask the guy if he wanted to go on a camping trip?"</p><p>"Wha? Why?"</p><p>"No reason. So this Bridge card - what did it look like?"</p><p>"How on earth would I know? Apparently your assistant did all the installation work! Moved his files and everything!"</p><p>In the far recesses of my mind I hear the sound of a 1p piece hitting the pavement.</p><p>"Ah! I'll get right onto it," I respond, reaching for a large hammer.</p><p>. . . Ten minutes later . . .</p><p>"So you moved his computer to a new case."</p><p>"I never!" The PFY cries.</p><p>"Sorry, let me put that a different way, You moved his computer to a new case."</p><p>"What's different about that?"</p><p>"This time the cattleprod in my pocket is charged up."</p><p>"Ah. OK, so I might have pulled a quick one."</p><p>"Indeed. And now he's found out about it."</p><p>"He can't have! I added 32 Meg of memory to the motherboard, slapped it into a brand,spanking new case, 'upgraded' it to XP, then changed the screen resolution!!! I also put that 'System Config Reporter' program you wrote which just displays whatever it's been told to report. Should work like a charm!"</p><p>"Obviously it hasn't. You can't just steal someone's upgrade and not expect them to notice. They expect a speed increase over all the other machines in their area. It's a status thing. The newest machine has to work better!"</p><p>"So you're saying I should have given him the upgrade his department paid for?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Of course not! Letting a helldesk geek have a shit-hot box just to play minesweeper and freecell between disservice calls is criminal!"</p><p>"Oh. So I should have upgraded my box, and given him my old stuff?"</p><p>"Of course not. Even that's still a damn good upgrade!"</p><p>"Well what else could I have done to make his machine run faster?"</p><p>"The keyword here is comparatively faster. It has to run faster than everyone else's because it's new."</p><p>"But how can I do that if I can't upgrade it?"</p><p>"It's obvious. You sneak in and downgrade everyone else's. Just pull half their memory out."</p><p>"They'll notice!"</p><p>"No they won't - they're sheep. Anyway, you just start a rumour that it's a network problem and they'll complain about that - setting us up for a gigabyte-to-the-desktop project."</p><p>"I think you're forgetting the people we're dealing with. These are helpdesk people!"</p><p>"Good point. Grab any additional memory out of their video card, and drop the CPU speed jumper down a notch while you're at it."</p><p>. . . One day later . . .</p><p>"And as you can see, the machine works appreciably faster than earlier models."</p><p>"It's way faster than mine," one of the guy's fellow geeks corroborates confusedly.</p><p>"In fact even boot time is increased!" I add.</p><p>"Mine doesn't even boo,t" another of the lesser intelligent member of the Helldesk adds. "I think there might be something wrong with the Network.."</p><p>Shooting's too good for them...</p><p>"It's still pretty slow," the Helldesk geek in question whines. "I'm sure it's not much faster than my original machine."</p><p>"Ridiculous!" I respond. "How long does it take to boot."</p><p>"About two minutes."</p><p>"And what about that machine over there."</p><p>"Just under five minutes."</p><p>"So it's twice as fast as the other machines!"</p><p>"Yeah, I suppose it is!" he gasps, seeing the silver lining after all.</p><p>(It's just bloody sad.)</p><p>"Mine still isn't booting," the really SAD geek says. "I think the network must be affecting DOS, cos that won't even load."</p><p>"Can't you do something about that?" The Boss demands.</p><p>"I suppose I could upgrade his network connection."</p><p>"OK, do that!"</p><p>"I'll go find get the.... six thinwire ethernet cards and some T connectors..." The PFY responds.</p><p>"Fantastic!" the geek burbles.</p><p>. . . the next day and six adaptor upgrades later. . .</p><p>"You realise there's only one 'upgrade' left after this?" The PFY asks.</p><p>"Yes I know, I'm just finding the OS2 disks now."</p><p>It's just sad... ®</p><p>BOFH is copyright © 1995-2002, Simon Travaglia. Don't mess with his rights.</p>
