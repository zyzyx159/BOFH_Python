            <h3>EPISODE 32 </h3>
            <br /><p></p><p>'Twas the night before Christmas, on Management floor</p><p>Not a creature was stirring, except by the door;
The Board Members' stockings were hung up with care,
In hopes that their bonus cheques soon would be there;</p><p>The workers had missed out - the bonuses few,
Just enough for the bosses, (and shareholders too)
The Bastard was slighted, this wasn't that good
Action was needed - a la Robin Hood.</p><p>The bosses were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of pound signs danced in their heads;
The Boss in his diapers, asleep in a trice
Was dreaming a storm about him and Posh Spice</p><p>When out from the freight-lift arose such a clatter,
The CCTV panned to see to the matter.
To the front desk ripped a guard in a flash
A stain down his front from a half-complete slash.</p><p>His view a white visage of fresh spray-on snow
Obscuring the larceny happening below
And what under his prying eyes else would it show?
The Bastard and PFY, hacksaw in tow.</p><p>With a tea trolley laden with construction brick
He'd know in a moment it wasn't St. Nick.
More rapid than diarrhoea, their work tools they came,
They chuckled, they sniggered, they called them by name;</p><p>"Now, HAMMER! now, HACKSAW! now, PHILLIPS HEAD and FLAT!
On, CUTTERS! On GRINDER! ERASER and NO-STATIC MAT!"
Away to the boardroom! Half-way down the wall!
The safe and its contents, soon open to all!</p><p>And then, in a twinkling, I heard near the tree
The sound of a chainsaw being started with glee!
A camera swung wildly, alert from the sound
In time to see pine needles, all swirling around.</p><p>Disguised well in fur, from his head to his foot,
The Bastard was watching, face blackened with soot;
Acetylene torch lit and fired up as well,
Cutting through plate steel - leaving quite a smell.</p><p>Alarm bells were ringing, followed by a shout
And silenced five seconds on - System problem no doubt
The smoke from the cutter had cranked up the pace
As sprinklers discharged themselves all over the place.</p><p>His eyes – how they twinkled! His dimples – how merry!
As the PFY "topped up" the Management Sherry
His droll little mouth was drawn up in a grin
As sherry was emptied, and now for the gin..</p><p>The videotape removed from a pocket unbidden
With scenes from the past year (from cameras hidden)
Some shocking, some sneaky, some fresh and some smelly
Timed later to screen from all lunchroom Tellys.</p><p>Security stumbled up four flights flat out
The lifts, they were broken - now figure that out.
He raced to the boardroom, be there in a tick!,
But look out! He's tripped over a sockful of brick.</p><p>They spoke not a word, re-instating the lifts,
Leaving stockings with brick, liberating the gifts
Collecting their spoils for the exit to night,
They stopped at the guard saying "You ain’t seen me, right?"</p><p>They sprang to the freight door, and out to the street,
Moving quite quickly - a night bus to meet!
And I heard them exclaim, as they mounted the bus
"Merry Christmas to all and the drinks are on us!!"</p><p>BOFH is copyright © 1995-2018, Simon Travaglia. Don't mess with his rights.</p>
