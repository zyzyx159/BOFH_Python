            <br /><p></p><p>So I'm sitting at my desk reading an online computing rag when The Boss trundles in.</p><p>"Could you add this name to our website please?" The Boss asks, handing over a glossy brochure with the Company's name emblazoned all over it, complete with the website address of our competitors.</p><p>"That's not our domain name," I murmur, pointing to the offending text.</p><p>"Yes, it's a good idea isn't it? We advertise our stuff with the opposition's site address, and then we get all their customers because all their people will come to our site!!!"</p><p>"They'll come to OUR site?"</p><p>"Yes! It's this idea a guy in marketing had. If we use their name, but tell our web server to talk to anyone who wants to get to their website - we'll get all their customers!!!"</p><p>The savouring process begins.</p><p>"So let me get this straight - We use their website address and get all their customers to our website?"</p><p>"By telling our server to pretend to be their server, yes."</p><p>"And this would work how?"</p><p>"The same way it did when you told our server to pretend to be the 'www' and 'jobs' servers. You know, virtual site, or whatever."</p><p>"Ah, Of course. But wait! I've got a better idea - Why don't we pretend to be Microsoft.com - and then we'd get all their web traffic - and that's bound to be a stack more than we'd normally get! And then, when people automatically go for one of those patches to make Windows less secure, we can advertise to them!"</p><p>"Do you think it would work?!" The Boss gasps.</p><p>"As well as the first plan!" I respond.</p><p>Before I get a chance put the slipper in repeatedly, he's off to assemble the Marketing Crew to tell them of his latest plan.</p><p>The PFY gives me a withering look which can only mean he thinks I'm digging a hole to fall into..</p><p>Half an hour later I'm starting to think that maybe he's right. The Boss is back with a huge list of dotcoms that the Marketing Dept has come up with that we could use to further our products.</p><p>"Cisco.com - very good, Yahoo and Hotmail - excellent, yes, it looks like you've got a good list here. You realise that they're likely to complain.."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Oh yes. And then it's legal problems - us having nothing to do with that industry - no end of hassles. Same for government sites."</p><p>"Oh," The Boss burbles sadly, no doubt wondering how he can break the bad news.</p><p>"Although I suppose you could use all the sites that get a stack of traffic, but have a less than happy existence with the legal system."</p><p>"But you said that we can't use Microsoft."</p><p>"No, I was thinking Porn sites."</p><p>"Porn sites?"</p><p>"Yes, Porn Sites. They get a stack of traffic and have a less-than-happy existence with legal authorities."</p><p>"Do they get that much traffic?"</p><p>"Well from our site alone the porn industry gets more hits than our website gets from the rest of the world."</p><p>"Really."</p><p>"Yes! I can show you the logs if you like! You'd be surprised who's looking at wha.."</p><p>"That won't be necessary," The Boss chips in guiltily. "So which sites should we use?"</p><p>"The popular ones, obviously."</p><p>"And they are?"</p><p>"Oh I don't know, I'd have to go and look to see which have a lot of content."</p><p>"How long would it take?"</p><p>"Oh, hardly any time at all - two, maybe three days."</p><p>"I've got installations to do!" The PFY blurts, not succeeding in masking his annoyance.</p><p>"I think that the installations could wait a while," The Boss responds.
10 minutes later..</p><p>"THREE DAYS OFF TO BROWSE PORN!" the PFY cries. "I LOVE MY JOB!"</p><p>"I think you're missing the point," I respond. "We're trying to find sites that would be used to promote the company, which means that you'll be grading sites on the following criteria: The number of visitors; Originality and breadth of content; Specialist Content and quantity of content. Once you've rated the sites on these scales you would TELL ME ABOUT IT TOO BECAUSE I LOVE MY JOB AS WELL!!!!"</p><p>..Three days later...</p><p>"..And unfortunately, it transpires that you can't pretend to be a site which is already set up, as the DNS won't direct enquiries to your machine simply because you pretend
to be that site!"</p><p>"This is terrible!" The Boss blurts. "So we can't even use our opposition's site name after we printed all that promotional material?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"So the whole thing's been a complete waste of time."</p><p>"Pretty much. Although we do have a comprehensive list of the best free porn sites in the world"</p><p>"Hmmm. Well I suppose we might be able to use it for some marketing purpose. May as well fire me an email message listing them."</p><p>"I DONT THINK so!" The PFY interjects.</p><p>"Look I don't have time to argue with you, just send me the message so I have something to prove that I wasn't wasting your time for three days."</p><p>"50 quid."</p><p>"That's preposterous! I'm not going to pay for research that you did on company time. And charging fifty pounds for it is ridiculous."</p><p>"Indeed it is," I cry. "It's worth at least 100! What with all those Teen, Bondage and Webcam sites you found yesterday."</p><p>"Bondage sites?" The Boss mumbles.</p><p>10 seconds later...</p><p>"And tell all your friends.." I say as The Boss leaves the office, while giving The PFY his cut.</p><p>"Fifty quid bonus!" The PFY blurts happily.</p><p>"I think you'll find it's 100 quid."</p><p>"No, just 50!"</p><p>"50 now, but 50 more when The Boss wants me to turn off website blocking (with our new updated list) in about 10 minutes."</p><p>"It's like a dream, isn't it?" he responds. "Only better." ®</p><p>BOFH is copyright © 1995-2002, Simon Travaglia. Don't mess with his rights.</p>
