            <h2>Simon and PFY gamify the interface </h2>
            <h3>EPISODE 5 </h3>
            <br /><p> "We put a fair amount of time into ideation sessions in an attempt to leverage your company's commercial value against the prevailing market perception," the suit says.</p><p>...</p><p>"Just, ah, back that up a little there – you put a fair amount of time into what now?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Ideation sessions."</p><p>"What's Ideation?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Idea Creation – you know, like brainstorming."</p><p>"Oh. Why didn't you say brainstorming, instead of using a 20-quid word like ideation?"</p><p>"Well it's quicker for a start."</p><p>"Even after I had to ask you to explain it to me?"</p><p>"Perhaps not initially, but I'm sure we're on track now. Anyway, we put a lot of time into ideation sessions..."</p><p>"He means brainstorming," the PFY says to me.</p><p>"I think he knows what ideation means," the suit says, getting a little snippy.</p><p>"No, no, he's right," I admit. "I have a shocking attention span when it comes to the 20-quid words that my assistant was talking about. In one ear and out the other."</p><p>"There's nothing new in ideation," he says.</p><p>"He means brainstorming," the PFY mumbles.</p><p>"I DON'T mean brainstorming – I mean idea creation."</p><p>"Okay, I'm with you now," I say.</p><p>"Right," he says. "So, we put a lot of tim..."</p><p>"But leverage, you said?" I continue. "You mean leverage as in blackmail leverage or lever and fulcrum kind of thing?"</p><p>"It's a simple term – everyone uses it," he chips back.</p><p>"I don't. Or rather I do when I have found some risqué conference photos on a cellphone I'm unbricking – or when I have an extremely heavy piece of hardware that is reluctant to exit the building via our window when a particularly annoying person is attempting to pry the 1 quid coin I superglued to the footpath directly below. Apart from that, though, nope."</p><p>"Well it's a word. It means using a business asset in a way which will help affect an outcome in another business asset."</p><p>"Right you are! So you're doing all that to our market perception?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"By updating the front page of our website."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"For 20 thousand quid."</p><p>"That's an estimate of our expense."</p><p>"Well I know where the first quid of that 20k will come from if you want to pop outside to the street below to get it while I find my crowbar."</p><p>"I don't think that will be necessary," the Boss says drily. "Let's just crack on shall we?"</p><p>"As I was saying, the ideation..."</p><p>"Brainstorming," the PFY mumbles to me.</p><p>"...session identified some learnings from a similar exercise we..."</p><p>"Learnings, you said?" I interrupt. "Not lessons?"</p><p>"No, learnings. From a lesson you might get learnings – things you learnt."</p><p>"And you couldn't say lessons? Or knowledge?"</p><p>"Moving along," the Boss says.</p><p>"We identified some learnings," he continues, "which we put into practice with your your company's public-facing image."</p><p>"You mean the front page of the website?"</p><p>"Yes. So we spitballed a couple of ideas..."</p><p>"Brainstormed," the PFY mumbles.</p><p>"...let them marinate for a while."</p><p>"Charged another 40 hours to the job while fart-arsing around on some other client's project," the PFY adds.</p><p>"And pivoted your interface into a gamification activity."</p><p>"Changed it into something that a child could use – because only a child would want to."</p><p>"I..." the suit says.</p><p>"Did you say gamification?" I asked.</p><p>"Yes, it's a model of using gameplay elements to engage with the website."</p><p>"Which game are we talking exactly?"</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Well which game are you trying to make it like? I'm quite a fan of murder in the dark. Get the lights, will you, Stephen?"</p><p>"I DON'T think that will be necessary," the Boss says, turning back to the suit. "Please continue."</p><p>"So with the gamified interface we could get some pretty good key takeaways about client engagement."</p><p>"You mean takeaways like an Indian? Or a nice kebab?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"He means indicators of client use of the website," the Boss bossplains. "So tell me, how would this be done?"</p><p>"Well, we'd on-board a couple of gamification ninjas to iterate a few possible strategies to solutionise the overarching interaction issue."</p><p>"I have no idea what he just said, but he mentioned gingers," the PFY mumbles.</p><p>"So the extra staff – they're included in your estimate?"</p><p>"Ah no, the 20k figure was the analysis of what is wrong with your current public face by one of our usability gurus. The solutionisation of that interface is a separate contract and would involve a couple of gamification ninjas working with one of our in-house design rockstars."</p><p>"You know some rockstars?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"So all up, what are we looking at?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"The whole shooting match? Probably around 45, 50. 60 if you want us to reach out to a vibe manager to really put a shine on it."</p><p>"OK," the Boss says. "I think we've made some real progress here. I'll just leave you with Simon and Stephen to flesh out some of the finer points."</p><p>...Half an hour later...</p><p>"Is it done?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"Well and truly leveraged," I say.</p><p>"So we can 'draw a line under it'?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"The decruitment process went well. And on the plus side, I got my quid coin back!"</p>
