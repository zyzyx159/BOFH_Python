            <h2>SCO? Never heard of 'em </h2>
            <h3>LETTERS SPECIAL </h3>
            <br /><p> It's not often that the Vulture Central Letters Directorate allows Reg reporters and contributors to bathe in the warm glow of praise.</p><p>This is not because the hacks don't occasionally knock out a half-decent piece, but rather to protect management against aggressive claims for more money/suite of offices/personal assistant, etc.</p><p>However, in the case of Simon Travaglia's recent BOFH: Protecting bodily waste in the public domain, we've decided to make an exception. Let the plaudits flow, starting with Dan Shadix:</p><p>That just might be the best thing I've ever read. Truly awesome.</p><p>And there's more, from Marcus Giles:</p><p>You owe me a new keyboard... ;-)</p><p>That was the funniest piece of work ever.. well done mate.. well done indeed :-D</p><p>The US loves BOFH too, especially Kevin Curry of Virginia Beach:</p><p>I just linked to your article through a Slashdot user comment. "Protecting bodily waste in the public domain" is brilliant!</p><p>And now that I've clicked your email link and see that you are a New Zealander, I love your work even more. :^)</p><p>What that means is anyone's guess. Of course, there's more to the latest BOFH than meets the eye. That, at least is according to Jos Osborne:</p><p><Round of applause></p><p>Never have I seen the Litigious Bastards situation so well put.</p><p>I congratulate you sir.</p><p>Litigious Bastards? What's that all about? Let's ask Jeff Asselin:</p><p>Nice jab at SCO. It's a shame most people won't even get the point, but well.</p><p>Jeff, you'd be surprised how many people did get the point, or at least as they saw it. Tim Bowden demonstrates:</p><p>I like to read the BOFH's on el reg as they are amusing, but this one had me ROFL. It has SCO down to a T.</p><p>Sam Christie also thought he had the point, and was prepared to be a little more explicit:</p><p>Pure brilliance. BOFH #8 is simply genius. You got off calling SCO an "unmitigated scum sucking, bottom feeding toerag". I wish all media outlets had the balls to do that. Keep up the good work!</p><p>Those readers who are none the wiser should look no further than recent Reg articles on the massive SCO IP punch-up which has seen the software company file law suits against various outfits, DaimlerChrysler included. This particular suit primarily revolves around SCO's accusations that the company put bits of Unix Systems V code into Linux, thereby gang raping its intellectual property. You get the idea.</p><p>However, in this case, BOFH fans are seriously misguided. Simon Travaglia has asked us to point out that BOFH is an entirely fictitious character and - in the tradition of the best TV disclaimers - that any resemblance to any individual company, living or dead, is purely coincidental.</p><p>Right, that's our arses covered. Let's end with the one lone criticism of this particular episode, courtesy of Fazal Majid:</p><p>Shit is worth far more than 50 quid, 550 pounds per tin, as a matter of fact:
