            <br /><p></p><p>It's quiet. Damn quiet.</p><p>And I like it! Apart from the boredom that is...</p><p>The PFY's skipped off to an extended lunch with some woman he was "accidentally" stuck in the lift with for a couple of hours yesterday, and I have the place to myself.</p><p>Peace.</p><p>Quiet.</p><p>Boredom.</p><p>>clickety<
>Ring<</p><p>"My mail's just come up with an error when I send - is there something wrong with the server?" the user whines.</p><p>"I doubt it, mail's still coming and going like it normally does," I respond, looking at the mailer logs.</p><p>"Not for me," the user snaps.</p><p>"Right, so the problem seems to be isolated to you, which means we should ask the technical fault diagnosis questions."</p><p>"You mean like: 'What has changed?'" he asks.</p><p>"No, more like: 'Who have you pissed off?'"</p><p>"What?!"</p><p>"Did you bring a car to work today?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Cut anyone off?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Park in someone else's park?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Fail to hold the lift door open for someone with a geeky look about them?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Say something nasty - however quietly and discreetly - about a technical support person?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Laugh when someone else did?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Date someone that a technical support person has had a recent failed relationship with?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Date someone that a technical support person is trying to have a failed relationship with?"</p><p>"What?! No."</p><p>"Run off at the mouth about some technical standard or the other which you don't subscribe to?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Push in front of someone at the lunch queue?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Push in front of someone geeky looking at the pub?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Spill your beer on someone geeky looking at the pub?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Only shout half-pints when it was your round at the pub?"</p><p>"No. And I don't go to the pub anyway."</p><p>"You don't go to the pub?! That could be it!"</p><p>"What?!"</p><p>"Yes, you're right, you're a user and it's next to impossible for a user to offend a technical person with their absence. Nope, you've got me stuffed, I have no idea why your mail client's not working!"</p><p>"It wouldn't be something to do with the O-something Service pack that the support guy installed this morning would it?"</p><p>"By service pack you mean something that looks like a cheap electronic clock with a couple of large waxy sticks connected to it by wires?"</p><p>"What! No, he installed something on my computer."</p><p>"Right, good point. Open your browser will you?"</p><p>>clickey< "Ok."</p><p>"Is your favourites tab full of links to porn sites, and has your hard drive been running non-stop since the 'Service Pack' was installed?"</p><p>"No, and.. uh.. No."</p><p>"Hmm. Perhaps they DID install a Service Pack…"</p><p>"That's what I told you!" he whines again.</p><p>"Yes yes, well done. What mailer are you using - Outlook Express?"</p><p>"No, Outlook."</p><p>"Which is updated by the Office Service Pack, not the OS Service pack."</p><p>"I...."</p><p>"Tricky."</p><p>"Yes, but when will I be able to send my email? It's important!"</p><p>"Of course it is - all our clients are important to us. Ok, I'll have to give you a call number to track this while I look into it. You'll need to quote this number when you call back, so write it down."</p><p>"OK."</p><p>"7PQ8339017B," I say, reading the serial number off my deskphone.</p><p>"7PQ8339017B."</p><p>"No, P."</p><p>"7PQ8339017P?"</p><p>"No 7PQ8339017B"</p><p>"That's what I said the first time!"</p><p>"Ok, read me what you've got?"</p><p>"7PQ8339017B," he blurts.</p><p>"Ah, I see the problem, it's 7PQ8339017B!"</p><p>"That's what I said!"</p><p>"With one B and one P."</p><p>"But not in that order," he says.</p><p>"In what order?"</p><p>"The BLOODY NUMBER!" he shouts. "7PQ8339017B!"</p><p>"Look, I can see that you're getting a little upset about this, so why don't I give you a shorter number," I say, calmly.</p><p>"Right. What?"</p><p>"17."</p><p>"17," he repeats.</p><p>"No 70, 7-0."</p><p>"70."</p><p>"And that's a shortcut to the first number?"</p><p>"Yeah, we don't get that many calls. OK, can you call me back in five minutes?"</p><p>. . . Five minutes of relaxation later . . .</p><p>>Ring<</p></p><p>"I'm calling about my call."</p><p>"Which call was that?"</p><p>"Call number 70."</p><p>"Seventy? That's not a call number!"</p><p>"You said you'd give me a short one, 70!"</p><p>"Ah. You don't have the 11 digit one do you?"</p><p>"NNGggg.... Yes, I WROTE it down. 7PQ8339017B."</p><p>">clickety< Ah right, you can't get to the website www.screaminglygaycontacts.com. Huh, there's no username logged against it. Hang on, I'll just put yours in. >clickety<"</p><p>"THAT'S NOT MY CALL!"</p><p>"Sure it is - it's the number you gave me."</p><p>"7PQ8339017B?"</p><p>"uhhhhhh, yeah."</p><p>"What about 7BQ8339017P?"</p><p>">clickety< Ah, user can't send mail. Short call code 17."</p><p>"Nnnnggggg... Can you take my name off the other call please?"</p><p>"The first call you logged?"</p><p>"I DIDN'T LOG IT!!"</p><p>"Oh, right. Well, I've assigned it to the helpdesk group, so you'll have to talk to them to get them to cancel it."</p><p>"I DON'T WANT IT CANCELLED, I.."</p><p>"Just want to get to the website, I know. Although frankly I think you should probably be doing that sort of thing from home..."</p><p>"IT'S NOT MY BLOODY CALL!"</p><p>"But you gave me the call number?"</p><p>"It was the number you gave me when I logged my call!"</p><p>"About not being able to get to the screamingly gay site. Yes."</p><p>"No, about my mail!"</p><p>"Your mail? What mail?"</p><p>"BASTARDS!" he snaps, slamming the phone down.</p><p>"Who's bastards?" the PFY asks, back from the pub with a 5 degree lean.</p><p>"We are, apparently. Guy's mailer won't work."</p><p>"That the user you blacklisted this morning cos you were bored?"</p><p>"Probably."</p><p>"Service Pack Job?" he asks.</p><p>"I think so."</p><p>"The CD version?"</p><p>"He called you a bastard," I murmur.</p><p>"Not the CD version then. Got any clock batteries?"</p><p>. . .</p><p>Boredom. The silent killer. ®</p>
