            <h1>BOFH: Don't go changing on Friday evenings, I don't wanna work that hard </h1>

            <h3>EPISODE 8 </h3>
            <br /><p> "It's just a small change!" the Boss whines.</p><p>"It's not a small change, it's a Friday afternoon change," I say. "We don't do those. We do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoon changes if you want, but not Friday. If it's urgent we might do a Friday morning change, but it has to be pretty urgent. Lives must be at stake."</p><p>"But it won't affect anything!" the Boss simpers.</p><p>"It COULD affect SOMETHING. Anyway, Friday afternoon changes are in our Standard Operations Procedures book as a no-no."</p><p>"What Standard Operations Procedure book?" he asks.</p><p>"THE Standard Operations Procedure book. For the Company. We had to create one several years ago as part of our auditor requirements and our contracted obligations – 'To ensure that we documented routine operations, procedures and company guidelines to avoid unscheduled outages, interruptions or degradation of services'. It was audited by the company risk assessors!"</p><p>"This is the first I've heard of it," the Boss argues.</p><p>"Well, you are newish in the role, but we've always had it."</p><p>"It's our Bible," the PFY adds. "The way we make sure everything is done by the book."</p><p>"Without it we'd be lost," I agree. "It details the steps we take in routine operations, but also outlines considerations that should be made when making changes to things."</p><p>"So it's a change control system?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"It's more than a change control system, it's a constant companion!" I say.</p><p>"So can I see a copy?"</p><p>"Of course you can!" I say, rolling open my desk drawer and ferreting around for a bit – to no avail.</p><p>I look to the PFY expectantly and he too does an alien probe into the bowels of his drawer to find a copy.</p><p>"There's one around here somewhere," I say, moving the crap on my desk around a bit, before working my way over to the bookshelves.</p><p>"Got it!" the PFY says, pulling a copy of the aforementioned document from underneath the espresso machine.</p><p>"The pages are all stuck together with coffee!" the Boss snaps.</p><p>"Yes, well, the machine has a leak."</p><p>"And you didn't notice that it was leaking onto your 'constant companion'?" he chips back with a tinge of sarcasm.</p><p>"Oh we've got about 10 copies of it floating around the place," the PFY says, which reminds me...</p><p>"Here's one!" I say, pulling a copy from inside a ceiling tile.</p><p>"What's it doing up there?"</p><p>"Oh it's just holding the fresh air inlet fan off the wall, so it doesn't rattle," I say.</p><p>"Why's it so thin?"</p><p>"This one's probably an early version," I say, while the Boss leafs through the pages.</p>
