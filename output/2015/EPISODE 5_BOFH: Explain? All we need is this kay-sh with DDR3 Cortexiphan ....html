            <h3>EPISODE 5 </h3>
            <br /><p> The PFY has crossed the line. Even though he knows better, he's attempted to explain something technical to management.</p><p>I don't know why he did it – he's aware of the risks, and yet he still did.</p><p>"KAY-SHING – not CASHing" he says, speaking slowly so the Boss can understand.</p><p>"But surely it's the same thing?"</p><p>"It IS the same thing, but if we use the KAY pronunciation it'll stop anyone thinking there might be money involved."</p><p>"What money?" the Boss asks, suppressing excitement.</p><p>I could honestly write a flowchart of the Boss' thought processes. It wouldn't be big:</p><p>The PFY knows this, but still every now and then he throws a pearl into the void.</p><p>"What he's trying to say" I blurt, deciding to help the PFY, "is that sometimes it's good to keep things close to you – for efficiency."</p><p>"How do you mean?"</p><p>"Well in your case you might keep a couple of stale lard sandwiches in your top drawer to save you driving home to get your wife to rustle up a culinary delight every time you get peckish."</p><p>"Oh, I just use the vending machine downstairs."</p><p>"Not the point," I snap. "But to explain further: if you have something that you use often it's better to keep it close than having to do all the work of going and getting it. You know – like how your wife keeps a copy of the book 'Coping with disappointment' on her bedside table instead of in the bookshelf."</p><p>"Or how you might keep cash in your wallet, because it's quicker to pull your wallet out instead of going to the bank every time you need to pay for something " the PFY adds, interrupting the Boss' thought processes before he gets offended.</p><p>"I... see."</p><p>"So in our case, while we might put all our data into the cloud somewhere what we're also doing is KAY-SHING our data locally. That way we have a local copy on the fast network as well as a backup – and remote access copy – in the cloud."</p><p>"So it would be quicker than waiting for the cloud?" the Boss asks hesitantly.</p><p>"For our on-site users, yes. Off-site users would use the cloud, which would probably end up being faster for them."</p><p>"So is our copy of the data called a 'near side cache'?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"No, it's just called a cache."</p><p>"But it's near us," he whines.</p><p>"It is, but most all caches are near – so the whole 'near-side' crap is what we call 'operationally redundant'. It would be like saying acne-ridden deep fryer operator, because all deep fryer operators are acne ridden. Or saying Idiot Boss because al-"</p><p>"Or money-grabbing, lying, pre-sales person" the PFY says, again interrupting. "So in the end we have this cache and it stores all the data we use most commonly – and because it's near it means that we won't be slowed down with accessing our data from the cloud – AND if there's an internet outage we can keep on working."</p><p>"Internet outage?!" the Boss gasps.</p><p>The PFY is on a roll today and I realise there was a line missing from my boss-brain-flowchart between what's-in-it-for-me and lunchtime:</p><p>"..I thought we had redundant internet?" he asks</p><p>"We do have redundant internet," I say, "but every now and then there's a possibility that a particular outage would be common to both of them.”</p><p>"Is there another internet?"</p><p>"Yes," I say, "but you need a bunch of Cortexiphan to make use of it."</p><p>"Cortexiphan?" the Boss asks. "Should we be getting hold of that? Is it a type of network cabling?"</p><p>Around about now I feel that I should leave the PFY to it – him being the person who opened Pandora's Box in the first place.</p><p>"Yes" the PFY lies. "And it's included in this server which I'd like you to sign off on."</p><p>"I thought you said that this was a KAYSHE thingy."</p><p>"It is a cache thingy, and if you look at the memory spec you'll see that it's been configured with DDR3 ECC – Extra Cache Cortexiphan. With this in our server it'll bypass network outages by having a backlink to online content."</p><p>The Boss is teetering on the edge of dummy-mode but he just needs someone to plant the boot of a tier-3 technical topology buzzword on his arse and give him a good push.</p><p>"It's tier-3 Cortexiphan we're looking at so obviously it's topology redundant with multiple backchannels and has the full dual Dunham processor architecture behind it. With a 2 Teraflop Bishop Gating protocol, obviously."</p><p>***DUMMY MODE ON***</p><p>"You know, I think I heard that somewhere," the Boss says, scratching his signature on a piece of paper.</p><p>...</p><p>Later, in Mission Control, I consider suggesting that the PFY might want to arrange a tragic workplace accident before the kit arrives and is deployed but then realise that everything I just thought was, as they say, operationally redundant. ®</p>
