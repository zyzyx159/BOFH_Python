            <br /><p> >knock< <knock<</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>"Hey there," I say. "I'm just here to fix your desktop machine."</p><p>"My desktop machine?"</p><p>"Yeah, just here to sort out the problems you were having with it."</p><p>"I'm not having problems with it."</p><p>"Sure you are."</p><p>"No I'm not."</p><p>"You are – I was talking to you on the phone about... 83 minutes ago and you said you were having a little problem with your desktop machine."</p><p>"I... don't think I did."</p><p>"Shannon, right?"</p><p>"Ah.. yes," Shannon says.</p><p>"Yeah, so we were talking and you said you couldn't help me because your desktop was playing up."</p><p>"I... don't... Which department are you from?" he asks.</p><p>"I.T." I say.</p><p>"I... don't think... I've ever met you," Shannon says.</p><p>"Well I'm not from your I.T. department."</p><p>"Sorry?" Shannon asks, even more confused than before.</p><p>"I'm one of your clients. I was asking you for information on the warranty on some hardware of ours because no one had turned up inside the contracted service period. I gave our reception a call on the way up in the lift and they told me there's still no sign of anyone."</p><p>"I.."</p><p>"And when I called you yesterday you said you'd call me back within the hour – but you didn't – so I thought it was probably that same desktop problem that you were talking about this morning."</p><p>"We have our own in-house people," Shannon says. "We're a service provider." "Might I suggest you just truncate that to 'service' and drop the whole 'provider' bit - just to keep you safe from some sort of false advertising scenario."</p><p>"I don't see..."</p><p>"Anyway," I continue, "as I said I thought I'd pop over and take a look at your desktop because if we're not seeing your engineers (and we have a guaranteed service window contract), then you – probably with no contract at all, being an internal user – are probably even less likely to get your desktop issue sorted out."</p><p>"I don't have a desktop issue," Shannon repeats again.</p><p>"You must do, because this morning when I rang to complain you said you couldn't bring up our contract details because you had a desktop issue. Then you said that you couldn't give me a timeframe for the repair because you couldn't open a new job without my client code. And not our actual client code, but an internal client code which we wouldn't have – because it's internal."</p><p>Shannon has decided that silence may be his best option.</p><p>"So I thought it's probably quickest for us both if I come over and take a look."</p><p>"I don't think..."</p><p>"Don't worry – I'll be at least as professional as your engineers. And by as professional as your engineers I mean the guy who showed up three days ago to swap out a failed drive, put the replacement drive in the tray the wrong way around and then rammed it repeatedly into the slot to try and get it installed – smashing the connector and shorting some of the connector pins together." "I... wasn't aware of..."</p><p>"Sure you were. I talked to you about this yesterday because your engineer said he'd be back yesterday with a replacement cable loom – only..."</p><p>"Look," Shannon says, trying to wrest control of this conversation from me. "I'm sure that there's a reasonable explanation for all this – a supply-chain issue, or.."</p><p>"But you said this morning that it was a desktop issue."</p><p>"Well I'm sure at the time I was having some sort of issue, but my desktop is working fine now."</p><p>"Are you sure? Only I've got three different-sized hammers here..." I say, pointing at toolbox. "I also have a 1/2 gallon jar of petrol – which probably has a street value higher than your desktop machine at the moment – also a tin of homemade thermite as well as a reciprocating saw with some sort of organic staining splashed all over it."</p><p>"I.."</p><p>"Does this carpet pull up?" I ask.</p><p>"LOOK" Shannon says. "There's nothing wrong with my machine. If there was I'd definitely be having one of our in house people take a look at it, simply to protect information we'd consider commercially sensitive."</p><p>"And by commercially sensitive information I'm assuming you're talking about a manila folder in your top drawer with the label 'How shit we are'?" I ask.</p><p>"Our commercial information," Shannon says angrily, "is none of your concern. If my desktop machine ever had a problem – which I doubt – then we would have taken care of it."</p><p></p><p>Who's that striding through your server room with a crash cart full of drives whistling Bernard Herrmann's "Twisted Nerve"? He doesn't look familiar...</p><p>"So you think it might be a server issue?" I ask.</p><p>"It could have been."</p><p>"Well, I can't tell you how relieved I am to hear that."</p><p>"Why's that?" Shannon asks.</p><p>"Oh, because my assistant let himself into your server room about 10 minutes ago with a toolbox full of drives mounted the wrong way in their trays."</p><p>"Maybe you'll see an engineer quicker than we have?" I say, easing myself out the door. ®</p>
