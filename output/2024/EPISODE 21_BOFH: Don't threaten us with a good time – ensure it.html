            <h2>Enterprise-level insurance? What are we, Trekkies? </h2>
            <h3>EPISODE 21 </h3>
            <br /><p> So we've got our annual insurance audit to validate the company's worthless cybercover – a policy with more get-out-of-jail free cards than a prison monopoly set.</p><p>"Just going over your general security settings … Can you tell me your password policy for users?" Brian, the guy from the insurance company, asks.</p><p>"Oh, they definitely have to have one!" I answer.</p><p>"Yes, but what is your policy?"</p><p>"That they have to have a password," I reply.</p><p>"No, I meant something like: eight or more characters, a mix of alphanumeric and special characters, minimum and maximum password lifetimes, you know."</p><p>"Hmm," the PFY hmms, "You know, I think there's some good ideas there."</p><p>"Do you mean to say that you don't have a password policy?"</p><p>"The users don't really like them – but I'm sure we could get them up to six characters if they added the year to their birthday …"</p><p>"Or even eight if we made them use a four-digit year," I suggest.</p><p>"Sorry, are you saying your users use their birthdate as their password?"</p><p>"Goodness no. It's usually their partner's birthday. Or their favorite child."</p><p>"So, you don't have any password policy?" Brian asks.</p><p>"No, like I said, our users have to have passwords. That's the policy. But we do like your ideas."</p><p>"What about administrator passwords?" Brian asks, scribbling away on his checklist with a red pen.</p><p>"Yes, we have those," the PFY says.</p><p>"I meant your administrator password policy?"</p><p>"Oh, well that's a whole different story. We have an absolute MINIMUM of two characters."</p><p>"Sorry, you mean you could have a password that's two characters long?"</p><p>"For emergency use, yes," I reply.</p><p>"For emergencies?" Brian asks.</p><p>"Yeah sure. Say there's been some security incident or something's gone wrong – do our users really want to wait while we type in some complicated password, which we'd probably have to waste time finding in a password book that we'd locked in a safe somewhere? Of course not. But with a two-letter password we'd probably have fixed the problem while one of your 'best-practice' people is still trying to get a two-factor response out of their iPhone."</p><p>We wait a while for Brian to scribble a few more notes with his red pen. "Uh … OK … what about document security?"</p><p>"We have a safe!" the PFY beams proudly, pointing at a small box across the room.</p><p>"That's a safe?"</p><p>"Well, it's a lockbox," I reply. "When the Beancounters stopped having a petty cash system they had a bunch of those left over, so we grabbed some."</p><p>"And what do you use them for?"</p><p>"Well that one has a backup of all our files on it, the one on MY desk has the building master keys, an all-access swipe card, and our password book in it. Oh, and the one on the floor by the door is full of lead shot – we use it as a doorstop. "</p><p>"And they're not bolted down?" Brian asks.</p><p>"Of course not. We wouldn't be able to put them in the cupboard when we go home."</p><p>"And you believe that's secure?" Brian asks.</p><p>"Yes – because we use a different cupboard sometimes – to mix it up a bit." the PFY replies smugly/</p><p>>scribble< >scribble<</p><p>"… … … OK. Talking about workday routine. How often would you say you use privileged or administrator access?"</p><p>"Hmm. Once a day," I reply.</p><p>"Ah," Brian says happily, reaching for his blue pen.</p><p>"Yes, we'll log in as domain admin and root in the morning and log out … when we go home."</p><p>"So you don't use a non-privileged user for day-to-day work?"</p><p>"We're not non-privileged users," the PFY explains, as if to a child.</p><p>Brian can see the way this is going and puts his blue pen away.</p><p>What firewall do you use?" he sighs.</p><p>"Between here and the server room you mean?" the PFY asks. "I think it's three sheets of plasterboard – but that's mainly for soundproofing."</p><p>"I think he means network firewall," I chip in, "and we definitely have one of those!"</p><p>"And it's an enterprise level, next-generation firewall?"</p><p>"What's Star Trek got to do with it?" the PFY asks.</p><p>… more scribbling with the red pen …</p><p>"Antivirus?" Brian asks.</p><p>"Yep. Every one of our users has Security Essentials installed."</p><p>"Microsoft Security Essentials?" Brian asks, horrified.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Does that even run on Windows 11?" Brian asks.</p><p>"Windows 11?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Windows 10 then," Brian responds, hopefully.</p><p>"Windows 10?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"You can't be still on Windows 8!" Brian gasps.</p><p>"Windows 8?!" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Are you on Windows 7?!" Brian asks.</p><p>"Yeah," the PFY says. "We bought a volume licensing key on eBay years ago – and it's the gift that keeps on giving! It has saved us a FORTUNE!"</p><p>>scribble< >scribble<</p><p>… about 15 minutes later Brian asks to borrow a red pen from us because his has run out …</p><p>THE NEXT DAY</p><p>"It's a disaster!" the Boss blurts. "Our insurance premium is astronomical! It's more than four times what last year's premium was, and comes with a list of caveats. We simply can't afford it."</p><p>"So the money that we'd budgeted for the software is now available to spend on … other software?" I ask.</p><p>"…?!" the Boss replies. "Did you do that on purpose?"</p><p>"Do what?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Did you make us uninsurable?"</p><p>"Have you ever read the policy?" I ask.</p><p>"I …"</p><p>"You're aware of the plethora of situations which would invalidate the contract?"</p><p>"I …"</p><p>"How broad the term 'reasonable care' is and how pernickety the definition of 'up-to-date' is, when applied to software, firmware, antivirus, operating systems, access control systems, etc?"</p><p>"I … So things aren't as bad as Brian was saying?"</p><p>"Well … we do have a password policy …"</p>
