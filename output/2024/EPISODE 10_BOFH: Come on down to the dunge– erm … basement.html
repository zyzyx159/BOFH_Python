            <h3>EPISODE 10 </h3>
            <br /><p> "And what was it you wanted to show me?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"It's just round this corner," I reply, listening to him wheezing his way behind me. "And then down a short passageway."</p><p>In horror-movie-land, this is just the sort of poorly lit alcove where all the eviscerations would occur, and I can tell the Boss isn't overly happy being here.</p><p>"Look, where are we going?" he gasps, as I slow down.</p><p>"We're here!" I declare happily, pulling a key out of my pocket and inserting it into a door lock.</p><p>"Surely there was a quicker way?"</p><p>"Ah, connectedness of things, life's rich tapestry, smelling the roses …"</p><p>"?"</p><p>"ANYWAY!" I interject. "We're here!"</p><p>"It's a pile of junk!" the Boss says, once I switch the light on.</p><p>"No, it's lots of piles – of not-junk!" I argue.</p><p>"It's junk." he continues, unconvinced. "And someone told me that you got rid of it all years ago."</p><p>"Oh well that was junk. But this, this is chemistry."</p><p>"Chemistry?"</p><p>"Yes. This is a visible manifestation of an extremely common, but as yet undocumented, chemical element."</p><p>"?"</p><p>"Hoardinium. An ignoble metal with an infinite atomic mass."</p><p>"I did chemistry," the Boss counters. "There's no such thing as an infinite atomic mass."</p><p>"Sure there is. Hoardinium has it – because it's ever increasing – and it's all protons."</p><p>"And where is it?" he asks, looking around.</p><p>"Well you can't see it, obviously. But you can see its effects. Like that pile of 8″ floppies over there."</p><p>"And what's the effect?"</p><p>"Well it's sort of a cross between magnetism, gravity and infinite valence."</p><p>"Nonsense."</p><p>"And yet here we are, with a roomful of stuff I can't part with," I observe, proudly.</p><p>"Sure you can. You could just read the data off those floppies."</p><p>"No, I can't – I don't have an 8″ floppy drive."</p><p>"So, they're junk."</p><p>"No, they've got saved games of Dungeon that I was playing 30 years ago. I've killed the thief, mapped the maze, and I'm only a few pieces of treasure away from winning."</p><p>"I don't know what any of that means, but you should just find a floppy drive and read the disk."</p><p>"I can't. The glue that holds the magnetic substrate on the disk has aged so poorly that the read heads would scrape the data off the plastic."</p><p>"So, they're junk."</p><p>"No. Don't you see? This is Schrodinger's data. It is both there and not there! I have both won the game and am still playing the game. The possibilities are enormous. Possibilities brought about by Hoardinium."</p><p>"I …" the Boss begins, struggling for words. "Well what about that over there?"</p><p>"That's a MicroVax tower – but it's special because it has an aftermarket memory upgrade, and it runs one of the few TCP/IP stacks that doesn't crash the machine every week or two."</p><p>"And that?"</p><p>"A ZX Spectrum – in its original box – with a third-party disk drive, extra RAM, plus the original monitor. In running condition."</p><p>"And what do you use it for?"</p><p>"You don't use it, it's computer history!"</p><p>"What about this? This is obviously a pile of junk."</p><p>"Those are: serial cards for a Vax 11/780, some memory controller cards for the 780, and some CI-Bus components – for the Vax 11/780."</p><p>"And do you have a Vax 11/780?"</p><p>"Not at this precise moment, no …"</p><p>"So it's junk."</p><p>"Nothing is junk if it has potential. And nothing has potential like an infinite number of protons."</p><p>"And that's junk too," the Boss snaps.</p><p>"Next you'll be saying that my bookshelf full of Vax manuals is junk too."</p><p>"It is junk."</p><p>"It's not – it has massive potential. Look, there's Fortran, Pascal and  Macro manuals, there's the runtime library manuals, system calls – everything you'd need to build a working Vax development environment."</p><p>"Couldn't you just do it on a simulator? With all the manuals on a USB stick or something?"</p><p>"WASH YOUR MOUTH OUT! The Hoardinium effect demands the real thing – preferably several identical copies of the real thing. See that bunch of keys there?"</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"They're all the same key: the 11/780 key switch key. I've got about 30 of them."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"You may as well ask me why I have 30 11/780 5-position switches."</p><p>"Why do you have 30 … err … switches?"</p><p>"Because they're great. That's the power of Hoardinium."</p><p>"There's no such thing as Hoardinium. If it had infinite mass it would have infinite gravity and implode the universe."</p><p>"That's the thing about ignoble metals."</p><p>"There's no such thing," the Boss counters</p><p>"There is. And their effects are precise and laser-like. Even now, I can feel the Hoardinium pulling things ever closer to me."</p><p>"Nonsense," the Boss huffs. "I think I'm done here."</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>"I don't even know why you brought me here. I can't fix any of this."</p><p>"Oh, I didn't want you to fix any of this."</p><p>"Then why did you bring me here?"</p><p>"Oh, I just needed you out of your office while the PFY took delivery of two Vax 11/780s. One of them has a memory expansion! I think there's still room in there for your desk and chair though …"</p>
