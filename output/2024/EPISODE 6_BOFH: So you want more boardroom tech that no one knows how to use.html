            <h3>EPISODE 6 </h3>
            <br /><p> I sometimes forget what it's like to deal with idiots.</p><p>With the PFY away with long COVID – or as we like to call it, "extra holidays" – I'm dealing with the phone calls he often fields.</p><p>"Yes, but it won't switch to 4K," my user gabs.</p><p>"It's not a 4K screen. It doesn't have 4K resolution," I explain.</p><p>"Yes, but my screen isn't 4K either."</p><p>"You mean your laptop can't do 4K, or when it's plugged into the screen it can't do 4K?"</p><p>"It's not plugged in."</p><p>"Are you screen sharing over wireless?"</p><p>"No, I think it's Bluetooth."</p><p>"Uh-huh," I sigh. "Are your display settings set to mirror your screen?"</p><p>"What does that mean?"</p><p>"Is what you see on your display the same as what's on the wall screen?"</p><p>I call it a "wall screen" because I've already been through every synonym for large screen with him to avoid confusing which screen he's talking about – his laptop or the 75" display on the wall.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"So I think what's happening is that when your laptop is mirroring it's probably 'dumbing itself down' to the resolution of the wall screen."</p><p>"Yes, but I need 4K."</p><p>I miss the PFY because about now he'd be yelling in the background "What sort of porn is he looking at?" and it's not the same if I do it.</p><p>"What sort of porn are you looking at?" I ask – because maybe I was wrong about it not being the same.</p><p>Nope, it isn't the same – and apparently the board don't think it's funny either.</p><p>"Perhaps you should do your presentation in the boardroom?" I suggest. "It's got 4K and a huge screen – and it's hardly ever used."</p><p>I refrain from launching into a rant about how much money the company has poured into the gaping hole of boardroom infrastructure. The place has more technology in it than a top-end conference center, and it would have been cheaper to have each of the board members fitted with some futuristic videoconferencing brain implant.</p><p>"Oh yeah, it's not working at the moment so we thought we'd just use one of the meeting rooms," my user admits.</p><p>And now I'm at a crossroads. Should I give up an entire morning to show someone how to use the completely working boardroom, with all its advanced features, again, or should I just get the crappy old wall screen going again?</p><p>"Fine, so what you're going to need are several magnifying glasses," I say.</p><p>...</p><p>"We need to do something about our boardroom technology," the Boss says, less than an hour later.</p><p>"No we don't."</p><p>"We do. We need to upgrade it to the latest technology."</p><p>"So we want an AI-powered screen?"</p><p>"No, I don't thi-"</p><p>"8K resolution?"</p><p>"Well, if that's what they have these days."</p><p>"Some screens do, not many laptops, though."</p><p>"Well, maybe we don't nee-"</p><p>"What about if we fitted all the board members with a futuristic videoconferencing brain implant?"</p><p>"What, is there such a thing?"</p><p>"No, but we could substitute a detonator cap with an inductive charging coil."</p><p>"And that would solve the problem?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"The next time they bent down to look at their wireless charger – yes."</p><p>"And this is the latest in video technology?"</p><p>"Not even remotely. But it would solve a problem."</p><p>"No, I think we need technical," the Boss demurs.</p><p>"Should it have a low carbon footprint?"</p><p>"Yes, definitely."</p><p>"So that'll be three months delivery time. In a solar-powered ship – which doesn't exist. But three months after it does exist we could have it. Or we could get it delivered by a solar-powered plane, which doesn't exist either, but doesn't exist even more than the ship. But it'll have a much shorter delivery time. Probably."</p><p>"What?" the Boss asks, adrift on an ocean of confusion. Possibly the same ocean that the solar ship will eventually cross.</p><p>"Should the screen be able to do video conferencing?" I continue.</p><p>"Oh yes!"</p><p>"At what resolution?"</p><p>"I ... what are my options?"</p><p>"640 x 480, 1280 x 1024, 4K, 8K, or Future K?"</p><p>"What's Future K?"</p><p>"That's a resolution that hasn't been invented yet."</p><p>"What's the point of that?"</p><p>"About the same point as 8K – but on the plus side the screen will likely be delivered by solar plane – so there's no hurry on that decision."</p><p>"Can't we just ..."</p><p>"LCD, LED, QLED, QNED, OLED, or QD-OLED?" I ask.</p><p>"I ... uh ..."</p><p>"OK, skip that, how dumb do you want it to be?"</p><p>"Not dumb at all! It needs to be smart! It should be able to meet all users' needs."</p><p>"Yeah, that's not going to happen. Our people can't even work an HDMI socket when it's built into a table, so there's no chance they'll manage higher technical interfaces."</p><p>"I think you underestimate our peoples' intelligence."</p><p>"Impossible. My estimations can't go that low."</p><p>"So what are you suggesting?"</p><p>"I was going to propose a group policy hack to reduce maximum desktop screen resolution to 1600 x 1200 (which no one will notice) and then disable wireless screen sharing."</p><p>"We can't do that!"</p><p>"In that case there's really only one option for the boardroom."</p><p>"Which is?'</p><p>"It's quite high tech."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"We just get the board to all meet in the same room."</p><p>"Yes," the Boss says. "Yes, that would work, wouldn't it?"</p><p>"And then fit them with those detonator caps."</p>
