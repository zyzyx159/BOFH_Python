            <h2>The world's first keyboard virus strikes </h2>
            <h3>EPISODE 4 </h3>
            <br /><p> BOFH 2001: Episode 4</p><p>It's later in the afternoon when I finally roll into work after a "Doctor's Appointment" to find the PFY printing up Virus warning leaflets espousing the latest thing in desktop danger.</p><p>"'The Q virus infects the letter Q on your machine, causing potential damage to any document with a Q in it.' Yes, I can see how that could cause a bit of havoc. No one will go for it, of course," I say.</p><p>"Why not?" the PFY asks defensively.</p><p>"They never believe anything we send out any more - not since you put that notice up about sound cards causing cancer."</p><p>"But that was an excellent warning, with fantastic response."</p><p>"Yes, it was. However, I think people got a little bitter and twisted when you subsequently sold all their desktop amps to buy that massive subwoofer for your machine..."</p><p>"It was needed!"</p><p>"What? To help people downstairs determine when you're losing at Unreal Tournament?"</p><p>"No, for the full audio experience of warning bells. So you think I've wasted my time with this then?"</p><p>"Not entirely. Of course the leaflet needs a little work, but it's saveable. I'll do a bit of editing while you pop down to the mail room and score us some shiny paper and a plastic sealer."</p><p>And so it was that the Q virus became top topic of the verbal agenda of the workplace the subsequent day...</p><p>"Ah, a quick word about this Q virus thing," the boss mumbles as he trolleys in at about .005 knots with a tail wind (probably the curry dinner from last night).</p><p>"Q virus?"</p><p>"Yes, the Q virus!"</p><p>"Never heard of it. And I'm on all the popular virii mailing lists!"</p><p>"Well it's all here in black and white," he cries, waving around a yellow flyer bulletin. Colours aren't his strongpoint.</p><p>"Let's see," I ask, grabbing the PFY's handiwork.</p><p>And impressive handiwork it is too - all credit to him. The correct mix of important looking fonts, jargon and shiny paper combining to give the illusion of authenticity.</p><p>"It's a joke!" I cry. "Whoever heard of a virus infecting a keyboard?"</p><p>"Like it says," the boss counters, "it's a... macro-symbiotic virus that, uh, attaches itself to hardware and uses the keyboard circuit borad matrix as a simple form of the... old-style core memory thingy."</p><p>"Yes," I murmur dubious, "those core memory 'thingies' can be problematic. But anyway, it's a prank - someone's obviously printed it as a joke."</p><p>"It's on shiny paper!" the Boss cries, playing his ace in the hole.</p><p>"We can print on shiny paper here!" I cry, giving the truth a bit of a spin. "Someone could've just grabbed some from the mail room and printed it on that printer over there!"</p><p>"AH!" the boss cries, playing another ace from a hole best not theorised upon. "But it came with one of our computing mags!"</p><p>"Someone just slipped it into the pages to make you look foolish!"</p><p>"I don't think so - it was sealed in the delivery bag - and I'm not the only one who got it - there was one in every issue! I've already been called by the Head Accounting Consultant to see if we've got an eradication plan."</p><p>"The Head Accounting Consultant? Isn't he the guy that once stapled a note to a floppy disk?"</p><p>"He says you told him it'd allow it to be used as an attachment."</p><p>"That's Ridiculous! But even if I had, surely he would have been intelligent enough not to do it. Imagine if I'd told him that an axe and wallpaper paste was the best way to perform a cut and paste!"</p><p>"They fired that consultant, as you well know. Anyway, I don't care, I think we should take the recommended action!"</p><p>"TRANSLATE ALL CAPITAL Qs IN DOCUMENTS TO LOWER CASE!? But it's already entered into the machine – it's nothing to do with the keyboard!"</p><p>"THAT'S WHAT ACTIVATES THE VIRUS!"</p><p>"Please. It'd take..."</p><p>"LOOK AT THIS!" the boss beckons, dragging me to his office so I can see the PFY's latest efforts have included removing springs from keyboards.</p><p>"It's not a virus, your Q key is just stuck down!"</p><p>"No, it's the virus. I was reading a document, and this happened!"</p><p>"And you used Alt-Q to quit?"</p><p>"Say what you like, it's all happening as the virus predicted. And we're only at stage one! I'm nipping this in the bud now before it infects other keys!!!"</p><p>Without further ado, the boss grabs the phone in 'executive-decision' mode, and gives the helldesk his orders.</p><p>Later that day...</p><p>"So, I've got all the Q keys quarantined," the PFY cries, holding up his plastic bag.</p><p>"OK," the boss gasps, in Jim Phelps mode, reading the warning sheet for his next mission. "Now we have to disinfect them."</p><p>It's truly sad what you can get people to do with a piece of shiny paper...</p><p>"We have to get the keys and place them in a metal container approximately 50 cubic litres in size and spin them around to disorientate the viral strain."</p><p>"THE MICROWAVE!" the PFY shouts, running to the break room and whacking the contents of the bag on High for ten minutes.</p><p>Eleven minutess later in mission control...</p><p>"So where would we get replacement keys from?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"THE VIRUS HOTLINE WILL KNOW!" the Boss blurts, punching some numbers from the sheet into his cellphone.</p><p>"Hello," the PFY says, answering his phone. "Virus Hotline..."</p><p>And if you listened very carefully, you could just hear the penny drop.</p><p>"What's it going to cost me?"</p><p>"For... um... 73 replacement keyboards at... say... ten quid apiece?"</p><p>"..."</p><p>"730 quid. But to you guvnor, call it 500. They're in the storeroom."</p><p>"But they already belong to the company!"</p><p>"Or maybe they're not in the store. Who knows, what with it being locked and all..."</p><p>500 quid later...</p><p>"I did like watching that negotiation taking place," I admit. "It was so..."</p><p>"Rewarding?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"No, next week's rewarding, this was... interesting."</p><p>"Next week?"</p><p>"Yes, you know, when the Mouse Ball virus breaks out."</p><p>"Ah, of course..." ®</p><p>BOFH is copyright © 1995-2001, Simon Travaglia.
