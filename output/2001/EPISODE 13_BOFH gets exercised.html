            <h3>EPISODE 13 </h3>
            <br /><p></p><p>It's extremely early in the morning and The PFY and I are in to perform some routine maintenance which really IS routine maintenance. Having noticed the payments application has a penchant for memory leaks which causes late delivery of contracting cheques every five weeks or so, we've decided to reboot the servers after slapping in the vendor-supplied fix.</p><p>And we've just finished the backup of the existing system - not being all that trusting - when the phone rings.</p><p>We ignore it of course - it's 6:30am and anyone in at work at this time and not at home asleep should be taken home and put to sleep, they're that sad.</p><p>The phone continues to ring on and off through the installation and reboot, and finally gives up around 7:30am.</p><p>As luck would have it - not ours mind - the user perseveres in a more traditional manner by ringing The Boss (who should be put to sleep as a matter of course), who deals with complaints in the time-honoured manner guaranteed to add value to the whole process - he passes it directly to us.</p><p>I walk upstairs and meet a new addition to the company, Carl, from the "Strategic Direction Unit". He motions me to a shiny chrome door which opens to reveal a small gymnasium with a panoramic view of the Thames. (As opposed to the staff one, if we had one, which would be si floors lower with a view - out a grate - of the side of a row of builders' skips. )</p><p>State of the art equipment in virgin condition surrounds me.</p><p>"It's all hooked up to the box over there," he gestures proudly. "You swipe yourself onto a machine, it brings up your profile, then sets the machine to the settings you use, depending on the fitness plan you choose. It's great, I can't understand why no-one has used it!!!"</p><p>"MMmmm" I agree, faking disbelief. "And your computing problem is?" I ask.</p><p>"This" he murmurs, tapping a treadmill.</p><p>"And how can I help you with that?"</p><p>"Well, I'd like you to fix it."</p><p>"It's a treadmill, not a computer..."</p><p>"But it's got a computer in it. And it's connected to one!"</p><p>"No, it's got a microprocessor in it - You may as well ask me to fix your cellphone!"</p><p>"Actually, my cellphone has a reception problem too! Do you fix them?"</p><p>"As a matter of fact I do. Let's have a look."</p><p>He passes the phone over and I chuck it in the bin.</p><p>"Right, time to use your phone insurance to get a new one."</p><p>"I.... Uh.. ... I see... Um, can you actually FIX the treadmill though?"</p><p>"OF COURSE I can! Give us a hand getting it over to the window and I'll get right onto it!"</p><p>"Are you proposing to throw it off the balcony?!"</p><p>"Of course not!"</p><p>"Good."</p><p>"No, it FELL off the balcony when you moved it to.. sweep up the place a bit"</p><p>"I don't sweep! I'm an executive!"</p><p>"Yes. It's funny, but I don't seem to recognise you.."</p><p>"I started on Monday. And just yesterday I discovered this gym, completely unused!!!" he responds keenly.</p><p>"Well, that'd be because of the Management fitness programme.</p><p>"Oh, they have a programme?"</p><p>"Puleeese! Have you seen the rest of upper management?" I ask. "As a rule they stop for a rest between floors in the LIFT!"</p><p>"Yes, I'd noticed. But as it happens, I've sent a memo to the board only yesterday asking them to sponsor gym introduction classes for management - Healthy Mind, Healthy Body - that sort of thing."</p><p>"Yes, you're right to start with the body I suppose. Thin end of the wedge.."</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>After remedying the problem (plugging the machine in and waiting for the self test), I take my leave. As "luck" would have it again, The Boss is waiting for me when I return.</p><p>"All sorted out" he asks nervously.</p><p>"Yeah, machine wasn't plugged in. Going like a charm now. All hooked up"</p><p>"Oh, you plugged it back in then? You wouldn't like to unplug it again would you?" he asks, a mild trace of hysteria present in his voice.</p><p>"Unplug it?"</p><p>"Yes, just that we're not all that keen on the exercise thing," he pants, puffing from the strain of even thinking about the possibility.</p><p>"WE'RE?"</p><p>"Me and the rest of the IT Management Team. And Accounts too, I hear.."</p><p>"I see. He'll just plug it back in tho.."</p><p>"Perhaps you could.. ah.. break.. it?"</p><p>"I'm sensing some corporate disloyalty here," I say, in a shocked and disappointed way. "If I didn't know better I'd think you didn't have the company's best interests at heart!"</p><p>"Of course we do. What would it take to prove that this is a bad thing for the company?"</p><p>"Fifty Quid should convince me.."</p><p>"Each.." The PFY adds.</p><p>"Manager.." I add, really getting into the swing of things and realising that none of them wants to be the one to wimp out...</p><p>"YOU WANT 50 QUID EACH, PER MANAGER!!!"</p><p>"No, you're probably right, having senior representation in next year's London Marathon is important.."</p><p>"I'll make some calls."</p><p>Two hours and two thick brown envelopes later, the requested "repairs" are made.</p><p>"And you're sure I won't have to actually</p><p>USE</p><p>the equipment?" The Boss gasps, wheezing from the effort of trying on his ill-fitting new workout gear which shows so much crack it's probably got a street value..

</p><p>"Nope, all you have to do is show up..."</p><p>The next day I'm called up early (again) to look at the exercise machines.</p><p>"Well," I respond, to the investigating officers questions while looking at the fitness computer, "it seems the treadmill was executing a standard running profile of nine kilometres an hour then changed to a sprint profile, of 50 kilometres an hour for some reason, hurling him out the window and into the builder's skip, into which I'd previously dumped all our old computing boxes - which was VERY lucky."</p><p>"Lucky?" the officer asks. "He broke both arms, an ankle and has a minor concussion!!"</p><p>"Nothing too serious then," The Boss comments.</p><p>The rest is history. With an excuse to mistrust the equipmen,t the Management team is out of there like a shot, leaving The PFY and me to clean up. A couple of words of advice to The PFY are sure to help.</p><p>"Ok, the exercycles were ok, but the treadmills' much heavier, so we're going to have to get a runup if we're to get it in the skip - I mean out of the way for sweeping.." ®</p><p>BOFH is copyright © 1995-2001, Simon Travaglia.
