            <h3>EPISODE 8 </h3>
            <br /><p> "Just a little H and S thing," the Boss says, popping his head around the door to Mission Control.</p><p>"?" the PFY and I respond wordlessly...</p><p>"There's some cables causing problems in the design department."</p><p>"Cables?"</p><p>"Yes, not sure what it is but maybe one of you could pop up?"</p><p>...10 minutes later in the coloured pencil office...</p><p>"You have a cable problem?"</p><p>"Yes - you see how they're all just hanging there around my desk?" the bloke asks. "The other day I got my shoe caught in them - and it could be a Health and Safety thing."</p><p>"I'm not sure shoe health comes under our H&S mandate," I say. "We mainly deal with people."</p><p>"No, I mean it's a trip hazard."</p><p>"Surely you'd dislodge them before you tried to stand up?" the PFY suggests.</p><p>"Yes, but sometimes I can't feel them."</p><p>"Okay, tell you what: we'll cable-clip them to your desk."</p><p>"Yes, but what if the clips come undone?"</p><p>"We'll put new ones in."</p><p>"What if we want to move our desks?" his neighbour chirps in.</p><p>"Okay," I say. "We're all friends here, what's the real issue?"</p><p>...10 minutes later in the Boss's office...</p><p>"They're nutters," the PFY finishes.</p><p>"Yes, but I still don't think you should have said that to their faces," the Boss says. "What was the real issue?"</p><p>"Electromagnetic Radiation... From the cables," I say. "Apparently, one of them overheard someone talking about the dangers of EMF and the whole office is paranoid about birth defects.</p><p>"And you thought it'd be constructive to suggest that the damage was already done and how all their parents must have lived next to power stations?"</p><p>"And what was their solution?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"Wireless. They want to take all the network and power cabling away, have a room where they charge laptops AT NIGHT, and use wireless to access the network when the machines are running on batteries during the day," the PFY says.</p><p>"I'm not sure we could..." the Boss starts.</p><p>"1. The battery won't last a day. 2. Every user has AT LEAST 2 large screens which don't run on batteries, 3. People will just forget to charge the things anyway. 4. Wir..."</p><p>"Yes, yes, I agree," the Boss says. "But they may have a bit of a mandate."</p><p>"awhatnow?" the PFY blurts.</p><p>"Apparently a couple of the users have been complaining about headaches for several years and the company cannot conclusively prove that..."</p><p>"...they're not complete nutters," the PFY finishes.</p><p>"AND SO," the Boss continues, "The Company Health and Safety officer has suggested a TRIAL of wireless technology."</p><p>"I see," I say. "But we all know that wireless has radiation too?"</p><p>"Yes, but apparently the users believe this isn't so harmful as they have that in their homes and it's OK."</p><p>"And they know that laptops produce Elec..."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"And you know that if we start this trial every tinfoil hatter in the building is going to be having headaches and needing health crystals and a salt lamp just to keep going?"</p><p>"Yes, but we still need a trial."</p><p>"O-kay..."</p><p>...The next day...</p><p>"Okay," I say, handing the PFY a baseball cap with a tinfoil lining hanging a very noticeable 1/4 of an inch below the brim of the cap. "Let's go install these wireless access points."</p><p>... Up in the upstairs office...</p><p>"So we'll install six units in the ceiling covering the entire workspace," I say. "We'll test them for a few days then cut you over to them next week. These units are the business - absolutely top-of-the-line!"</p><p>"Great!" one of the halfwits says.</p><p>The PFY and I get to work installing the units and cabling them up.</p><p>"What... are the caps for?" one of the idiots eventually asks.</p><p>"Oh nothing!" I say. "We just had them around the office."</p><p>"You don't normally wear them."</p><p>"No, because we're not normally out of the office this long."</p><p>"I just notice that... they've got some sort of metallic lining," he says hesitantly.</p><p>"Oh that, that's nothing!" I say. "We're just trying out a... new..."</p><p>"...Dandruff treatment," the PFY says, right on cue.</p><p>"Yes! A dandruff treatment!" I say.</p><p>We install the points and leave the office to let the crazy ferment. The next morning we're in the Boss's office again with a couple of the blokes from the coloured pencil office.</p><p>"You need to change out the wireless access points," the Boss says.</p><p>"Why's that?" I ask.</p><p>"Because the radiation from them is causing headaches. Everyone in the office is getting them now."</p><p>"We haven't configured the wireless interfaces yet!" the PFY says. "They're not even turned on!"</p><p>"We're still getting headaches," the head-desker says.</p><p>"Well, we've reached an impasse then," I say. "If you can't do wireless and you can't do cabled I don't see..."</p><p>"It's the type of wireless," he chips back. "The units you put in must be too powerful."</p><p>"When they're not turned on," the PFY points out again.</p><p>"We think you should be using ones like in our home."</p><p>"Oh you want domestic access points!" the PFY says. "I can pop down to Currys and get them if you like. How about reducing the number of units to three - to keep the power down?"</p><p>"I think that would be best," he says.</p><p>And that's how we got a top-of-the-line wireless upgrade for the office without the cost coming from our network hardware budget. And all it took was an overly loud conversation about EMF in the lunch line...</p><p>It's just business.</p><p>And if you think the paranoia's bad now, imagine what it'll be like next week after the PFY and I pop up to the users' office later this evening with a couple of heat guns and melt everything plastic within 1 metre radius of the domestic units...</p>
