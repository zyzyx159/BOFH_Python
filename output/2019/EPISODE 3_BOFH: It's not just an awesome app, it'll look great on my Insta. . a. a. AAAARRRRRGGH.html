            <h3>EPISODE 3 </h3>
            <br /><p> Fifteen months ago...</p><p>"It makes complete sense," the Director burbles. "We need the software and Philip's prepared to write it."</p><p>Philip, in this case, is the Director's nephew and is part-way through his "technology" degree and "knows a thing or two about programming"...</p><p>"So do we have an analysis of needs, a timeframe and a clear definition of what it is we want him to write?" I ask.</p><p>"I think we all know that we just need the software to fix our current issues and we want it as soon as possible," the Director says.</p><p>"Around a month or two," Philip estimates.</p><p>"Well, good to know we sorted that out then," I say.</p><p>The present day...</p><p>"So within a couple of weeks we should have this nailed," the Director says happily.</p><p>"And all I'll need to know is what phones you use so I can program that into the system," Philip says.</p><p>"Well, I'm an Android user, but I identify as an iPhone user," the PFY says.</p><p>The Boss blinks.</p><p>The Director blinks.</p><p>Philip blinks.</p><p>No one wants to be the first to say that this isn't a thing – just in case it is a thing.</p><p>But it's not.</p><p>Still... no one wants to say it.</p><p>. . .</p><p>It's a bit like the time the PFY wanted a disabled parking spot for medical reasons. Medical reasons that turned out to be IBS – and not the real IBS either. That said, the PFY's demonstration of his "inflammable" bowel syndrome is something the building's still talking about – long after the Boss's eyebrows grew back.</p><p>"So what's left to be done?" I ask.</p><p>"Well," Philip says, "the app is pretty much all there on the iOS and Android platforms; I just need to do a little tweaking on the screen models and the notification scheduling then I'll start work on the backend."</p><p>"So we currently have..."</p><p>"The app. Mostly," Philip says.</p><p>I feel the pink mist descending on me and notice a very prominent vein in the PFY's forehead at the same time. I look to the Boss and his Adam's apple is going down and up faster than cake at a bulimia dinner so I can tell he too is thinking about how much money we've wasted paying Philip to create something with all the functionality of a static web page.</p><p>"So. How long. Will the backend. Take?" the Boss chokes out.</p><p>"Oh, a month or two, I'd expect," Philip says. "There were a lot of changes to the app which pushed the development out quite a bit."</p><p>"My fault," the Director blurts. "I gave him a couple of pointers on font selection and colours."</p><p>"And there was some other stuff too," Philip says.</p><p>"Yes, well, my wife had a couple of suggestions."</p><p>"Not using orange on black and limiting the number of fonts to two," Philip adds.</p><p>"And that took more than a year?"</p><p>"Well, I needed to do a couple of complete rewrites when I changed from C++ to C# and then back to C++ – for functionality."</p><p>"WHAT BLOODY FUNCTIONALITY?!" the PFY cracks. "THERE'S NO BLOODY FUNCTIONALITY! IT'S NO MORE FUNCTIONAL THAN A PIECE OF PAPER!"</p><p>"I... think that's a little inaccurate," the Director says calmly.</p><p>"He's right," I say to the PFY, nodding to the Director, "because at least you can wipe your arse with a piece of paper – and paper knows what to do with a backend."</p><p>"It's just a backend issue, it shouldn't take too long."</p><p>"So you've looked at the backend?" I ask.</p><p>"No, but..."</p><p>"Do you even know what the backend is?"</p><p>"No, but.."</p><p>"Do you know what a backend is?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"It's the database," Philip says drily.</p><p>"Could be a database, could be a mail system, could be a API or even a physical interface. Do you know which one you're using?"</p><p>"Well, I'm not too sure what I'm going to be reporting on just yet, but the client is fully functional."</p><p>"HOW CAN IT BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING TO?!" the PFY rages.</p><p>"It's just an interface," Philip burbles. "I'll just massage the input into a format that matches the outputs on my app."</p><p>"What are the outputs on your app?" I ask.</p><p>"It's a dashboard traffic light, with Green being Normal, Orange being Warning and Red meaning Critical."</p><p>"Are there any inputs in your app?"</p><p>"Of course, there's swipe down to refresh and a reset button."</p><p>"What does the reset button do?"</p><p>"At the moment it just clears the screen and does a refresh – but in the future it'll clear the screen, resync the data at the other end and then refresh."</p><p>"And by resync you mean refresh?"</p><p>"Well, yes."</p><p>"So let me get this straight," the Boss says, pressing a thumb to his eyesocket as he contemplates the low-tech wall that his entire development budget has been pissed up against.</p><p>>updown< >updown< >updown<</p><p>"We've paid you to make an App – on a phone, with three different coloured words..." .... >updown< >updown< >updown<... "and ONE input – that doesn't actually talk to anything at the other end yet?"</p><p>"Well, no one's told me what's on the other end yet," Philip says defensively.</p><p>"Have they not?" the Boss asks, finally understanding the problem.</p><p>"Well, it's right over here."</p><p>"Where?" the Director asks.</p><p>"Over here..." the Boss says, looking pointedly at the PFY and myself.</p><p>"... by the window."</p>
