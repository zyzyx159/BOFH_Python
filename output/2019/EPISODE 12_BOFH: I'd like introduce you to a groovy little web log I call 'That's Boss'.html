            <h1>BOFH: I'd like introduce you to a groovy little web log I call 'That's Boss' </h1> 
            <h2>You know what the kids will think is boss? You, tweeting from that window ledge </h2>
            <h3>EPISODE 12 </h3>
            <br /><p> "We'd like to Twitter our information to the world," the Boss gasps happily – in much the same excited tones as one would expect upon the discovery of a cure for cancer, a path to world peace, or a piece of "free" software that doesn't inject a toolbar into your browser the moment you click next.</p><p>"I think the word you're looking for is tweet," the PFY chips in drily.</p><p>"No no, I want to use Twitter."</p><p>"Yes, and a Twitter post is called a tweet."</p><p>"As opposed to a twit, which you may have heard before," I add.</p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p>"Yeah, you're bound to have heard it," the PFY says.</p><p>"I mean about tweet – are you sure that's what it's called?"</p><p>"Pretty sure. But you don't want to use Twitter anyway – you want to do a web blog like one of our beancounters does!"</p><p>"One of our accountants has a blog?!" the Boss asks, upset about missing that boat.</p><p>"Oh yes. It's an interesting read, too," the PFY says, tapping away on his keyboard. "Look.. >click<"</p><p>"Are you sure that's one of our.."</p><p>"Oh yes. And he goes on... >click<"</p><p>"Yes, but are you sure he's one of our.."</p><p>"Uh-huh.. >click<"</p><p>8:33am 4th floor: Consider hurling myself out the window but am unable to do so because access is blocked by my co-workers, all of whom are scheduling Window Plan reviews into their calendars for early next week.</p><p>"Goodness, do you really think he..?"</p><p>"Who cares?" the PFY asks, anticipating the question. "But you see the problem?"</p><p>"Uh.. not entirely."</p><p>"Most people have nothing interesting to say on a regular basis. As the frequency of tweets increases, the resemblance of tweets to senile dementia increases proportionately - particularly where politics is concerned."</p><p>"I'm 73 you know," the PFY says, by way of demonstration. "I've still got all my own teeth. They're the best teeth in the world. Let's make teeth great again!"</p><p>"Yes well, I can see how tha..."</p><p>"My teeth have their own Twitter account," the PFY says. "It's the best Twitter account in the world apart from my hair's Twitter account."</p><p>"I hardly think..."</p><p>"I've just pooped my diaper!" The PFY whines. "My bag needs changing."</p><p>"Enough!" the Boss says. "We want to provide a method of communication to permit us to pass on interesting bits of information to our clients."</p><p>"What are we calling 'interesting' these days?" I ask.</p><p>"How the company is doing."</p><p>"EEEEEEERR!" the PFY says. "Game over Player 1."</p><p>"Who is has been appointed to the board?"</p><p>"I just came out of my coma," the PFY says. "It was the best coma in the world."</p><p>"What the share price is!" the Boss cries.</p><p>"Nope. See, it's not as easy as you think is it. So instead you just end up with a blogful of drivel and a follower base of one. But if you post something interesting – something that keeps your readers on the edge of their seats – well then you'll have real followers."</p><p>"And it would promote the company?" the Boss asks. "Because I may have suggested that it would at a board meeting."</p><p>"Let's face it, no one's going to follow a company blog. They're dull as dishwater. But if there's something salacious or interesting, then people start watching – and you can inject company promos and picture adds into your blog."</p><p>"What do you mean by salacious and interesting?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"The gradual decline into self-aggrandising dementia seems to pull in a lot of followers at the moment," I say.</p><p>"It's the best dementia in the world," the PFY adds.</p><p>"But if you want real followers," I say, lowering my voice, "you want to eclipse our Beancounter friend. He's doubled his followers every day for the past week, which is no small feat."</p><p>"So what – I should blog about the futility of my own existence?" the Boss says dubiously.</p><p>"Of course not. Just get the PFY to blog about it for you. You'll have so many followers you won't have to do with yourself!"</p><p>"And I'll be able to promote the company?"</p><p>"I can guarantee you that the company will get a surge of publicity!"</p><p>"And you're sure this will work?"</p><p>"100 per cent," I say, quietly removing the safety lock from the window...</p><p>...</p><p>The best windows in the world.</p>
