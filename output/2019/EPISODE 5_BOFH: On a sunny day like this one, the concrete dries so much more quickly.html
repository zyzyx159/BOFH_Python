            <h3>EPISODE 5 </h3>
            <br /><p> "I've forgotten more about computing than you'll ever know!" I snap at the PFY in response to a sarcastic remark.</p><p>"OK, then – how do we get it to go?"</p><p>"I don't know, it's one of the things I've forgotten," I admit.</p><p>Man, I hate old computers. No: I hate old computers which have some non-standard config – like most old computers.</p><p>You know, when you have to boot the company's ancient financials system (which has been sitting, OFF, for so long that it has a layer of dust littered with coffee rings and cigarette burns) so an auditor can check back to *2004* to see what price we paid for 24/6 size staples because they suspect we misattributed the costs to the wrong cost centre and if THAT'S the case then it's potentially indicative of a blasé attitude towards cost management – which could seriously affect the ongoing commercial viability of the company, etc, etc.</p><p>Obviously this is the sort of financial problem that is usually sorted out when there's a big concrete pour scheduled at a nearby building site with shockingly lax after-hours security. However, auditors are like cockroaches and there's always another one behind the fridge waiting to make themselves known.</p><p>We boot the server to find there's something up with the RAID array because the unit has been powered off so long that the standby battery has become more of a lie-down battery.</p><p>"Isn't the RAID config stored in a sector on the disk?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Yes but it wants an address from 00 to FF."</p><p>"00 – the default."</p><p>"Bound to be!"</p><p>"Uh-oh," the PFY says, looking at the volume information.</p><p>"Indeed," I say, looking at the two failed drives in the array.</p><p>Now waaaaay back in the day, a bad drive used to mean an overnight tape recovery session – but then RAID-5 came along. Even though it had the write speed of a blind scribe with Parkinson's and prostate problems, it was reasonably reliable – until you lose two disks.</p><p>"Reboot," I say to the PFY.</p><p>>Click< >BEEEEEEEP< >SMACK< >Whirrr<</p><p>"What the hell are you doing?!" the Boss gasps, coming into the room for a staple update.</p><p>"Stiction," I say.</p><p>"ONE failed drive," the PFY says moments later when the RAID config shows. "Hot swap?"</p><p>"Going to have to be. Now all we need is a 160Gig... oh... SCSI... drive."</p><p>NGGGGGAAAARGH!</p><p>...</p><p>Two days later we have a replacement drive – the major component of the cost being the shipping – and the disk gets replaced. Our next problem is the operating system, because no one can remember what the bloody admin password was back then.</p><p>A reboot and password zero later we find the machine is part of our old domain and needs domain credentials to start the database.</p><p>A trip to the Storeroom of Doom later and we have an ancient domain controller which, after booting, complains about a missing BDC but limps along in an about-to-die manner regardless. We then find out the licence for the financials software expired in 2005, so a couple of clock resets later we're back in 2004 and resetting the domain passwords and starting the financials system. All that's left now is to find a desktop machine from the beginning of time that has the financials client installed on it...</p><p>...</p><p>"I told you we should have virtualized everything," the PFY says.</p><p>"Maybe so," I say, hefting a fancy "dual-core" desktop machine from the store onto the desk, "but hoarding pays off in the end."</p><p>...</p><p>"Is it done?" the auditor asks, entering Mission Control with the Boss.</p><p>"Probably," I say. "We have one of the original client machines, the original server and original domain controller all plugged into a cheap eight-port switch. With any luck you should be able to login with these credentials. >scribble<."</p><p>>tappity< >tap< >tap< >click></p><p>>tap< >click<</p><p>"Well... I'll just leave you to it then?" the Boss asks, quickly bored with watching someone negotiating an aeons-old chart of accounts.</p><p>"Uh-huh," the auditor says distractedly as the Boss wanders away.</p><p>>tap< >tappity< >tap<</p><p>"Hmmm," he says a few moments later.</p><p>"Hmm?" I ask.</p><p>"Have you made any changes to this?"</p><p>"You mean apart from resetting some ancient passwords and replacing a hard drive?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Yes. No: I mean have you changed the data?"</p><p>"I shouldn't have thought so," I chip back. "It should be in the same state as when it was switched off years ago. An orderly shutdown, most likely, and the disk replacement was like-for-like in a hot-swap RAID set, so that should have been OK too. Why?"</p><p>"It's just the data," he says. "According to this," he says, pointing at a row in a table, "back in 2004 the IT department spent almost £3,000 on staples – and the supplier name is 'The Blue Posts'."</p><p>"Oh yes!" I say. "Blue Posts office and stationery. They closed down in 2005 and the new tenants put a pub up in its place – and named it after the stationery shop."</p><p>"Really?" he says, with a just a hint of absolute disbelief.</p><p>"Yes, they even have photographs in the front bar of the old stationery shop when it was running."</p><p>"And where is this pub?" he asks.</p><p>"It's only a couple of streets away."</p><p>"I think I'll need to verify this for myself," he says – again with that hint...</p><p>"No problems, we can shoot down there tonight, it's just past that new building they're starting to put up..."</p>
