            <br /><p></p><p>>SQUEAK<</p><p>...</p><p>"Impressive," our recent ex-new-Boss says nervously, edging towards the back of the room. "How did you... find us?"</p><p>"Simple," the PFY says, entering from the door behind him, cattleprod in hand. "One of the laptops you took wasn't exactly what it looked like."</p><p>"Bitlocker?" the ex-new-technician asks, halting his in-tandem retreat along with the ex-Boss.</p><p>"No," I respond, fingering my own modded prod. "The machine had built in wireless and GPS and used scripted netstumbler to peer with any access points it could find and report its location."</p><p>"Really?" the ex-boss asks.</p><p>"Nah, the PFY lifted your wallet the day you started and stole your credit card details and personal information. We followed you here from your home."</p><p>"Ah," the ex-Boss says. "Which was why I found my wallet on the floor behind my desk last week."</p><p>"Indeed. Why steal a wallet when the cards would be deactivated within the day? No, it's far better that you feel you mislaid it for a moment and give us the opportunity to order a month's worth of crap to be delivered to your home."</p><p>"Crap?"</p><p>"Gym gear, PC games, porn, and diet products."</p><p>"Ah," the ex-Boss says knowingly. "All stuff which is very hard to return..."</p><p>"And you might have made donations to a number of internet based organisations with anti-democratic viewpoints â€“ so I wouldn't do any flying in the near future."</p><p>"Either of you," the PFY says nodding at the ex-technician. "Those messages you were posting about Western infidels are almost certainly being read by anonymous men in a grey building somewhere in the city..."</p><p>"Which is why returning home is probably not your best option," I add.</p><p>"Not with the three sacks of fertiliser under your stairwell anyway..." the PFY adds.</p><p>"I..."</p><p>"Have our equipment and are only too willing to give it back to avoid a nasty incident?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Yes?" the ex-technician suggests.</p><p>"And compensate us for our time with a couple of hundred quid?" the PFY adds.</p><p>"Fifty," the ex-Boss says.</p><p>"Each," the PFY counters.</p><p>"Done!"</p><p>And a deal is struck. Being consummate professionals they know a lost cause when they see it. Moments later the PFY and I have keys to a North London lockup, a little cash, and an agreement that the company will have learned some valuable lessons from the incident.</p><p>"So how did you manage to get the gear out so quickly?" the PFY asks as we have a post-truce pint with the ex-Boss and ex-tech.</p><p>"We got some magnetic signs made for a fake PC repair company then slapped them on a rental van," the ex-tech explains.</p><p>"Then we got a couple of lab coats, a clipboard, and started loading up gear. Amazing what people will fall for."</p><p>"And security didn't say anything?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Nothing apart from 'this is heavy'."</p><p>"You used security to help steal stuff from the company?" I sigh.</p><p>"Oh yes, they were most helpful."</p><p>"Ah well, I suppose the company will learn something from this..." I say.</p><p>"Although not much," the PFY adds.</p><p>"No?" our ex-Boss asks.</p><p>"No, the current brainwave of the head of IT is to fit out our Madrid office with kit that we configure here - network, desktop and server - and just talk them through the install on the phone!" the PFY snaps.</p><p>"Really? Much kit?" our ex-Boss asks eagerly.</p><p>"A bit - but don't even think about it - it's being shipped privately. It SEEMS that the CEO's bought a villa in Spain and is going to get the company to pay for his shipping container by putting the computing gear in with his stuff."</p><p>"Sounds like someone needs to be taught a lesson..." our ex-tech says.</p><p>"You mean..." our ex-Boss asks.</p><p>"Uh-huh. We could rent a van full of empty computer boxes that need to be put into the container at the last minute."</p><p>"50/50 on the proceeds?" the PFY asks.</p><p>...Late the next night at the Cargo terminal...</p><p>"They must employ the same security staff as we do!" the PFY gasps. "I mean who's going to believe we're Rabies inspectors!"</p><p>"What was the container number?" the ex-Boss asks nervously, knowing we've got a fairly small window to do this in.</p><p>"Here," I said, handing over a shipping receipt.</p><p>"Okay... " he responds, driving slowly past rows of containers waiting to be loaded. "... BINGO - and it's at ground level!"</p><p>>Creak< >Clank< >Groaaaan<</p><p>"That's odd," the ex-Boss says. "There's computing boxes here but the furniture's complete crap."</p><p>"Well you guys go in and grab the stuff while the PFY and I grab the 'replacement' kit," I say.</p><p>"Okay... hang on, these are just empty b..." >GROAN SLAM!< >CLANK<</p><p>"Amazing what people will fall for," the PFY says, shaking his head and screwing up the shipping receipt.</p><p>"Still, a holiday in Spain can't be all bad," I say.</p><p>"True," the PFY says. "And I made sure to put the sacks of fertiliser next to the torch - so they know what to expect when we dob them in to the Coast Guard..."</p><p>"Okay then," I say. "We're about done. But before you return their van to the hire company..."</p><p>"Yes, I know," the PFY sighs. "Back into a solid object a couple of times, use up all the gas and wait outside a kebab place until someone's sick on the passenger seat."</p><p>As they say, vengeance is a pre-digested meal best served on pseudo leather...</p>
