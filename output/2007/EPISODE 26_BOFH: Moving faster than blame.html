Nope. It's not," the PFY counters.</p><p>...Seconds later in the server room...</p><p>"The lights say it's working ok," the PFY says, tapping the SAN box.</p><p>"Yeah those two green lamps really tell you a lot," I say. "Course, if the disk activity lamps were doing anything it would probably mean more to me..."</p><p>"Ah," the PFY says "I hadn't noticed that. It's crashed then, has it?"</p><p>My affirmative response is partially interrupted by the ringing of the server room phone which has a dual purpose - to contact us when we're inside the room and to indicate that the Guild of Idiots has taken up camp outside Mission Control with a view to finding out both what happened and when service will be restored.</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>We wander outside and to talk to the assembled group.</p><p>"So what happened?" the head Beancounter wheezes, being a bit tuckered out after the walk from the lift.</p><p>"The SAN has crashed," I say.</p><p>"When will it be back?" the head of HR asks.</p><p>"After it's been reset and done it's data rebuild," I say.</p><p>"Have you reset it?" the Boss (and final Guild member) asks.</p><p>"Nope, it's remotely managed - remember?"</p><p>"No?" the Boss says.</p><p>"They do," the PFY says, pointing at the other two guild members.</p><p>"What do you mean?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"The companies that produce our HR and finance software merged last year and created a single unified product," I explain.</p><p>"Their merger was so successful that they approached a hardware vendor to come up with what would be a complete turnkey solution," the PFY adds.</p><p>"A turnkey solution so simple that an idiot could administer it," I murmur.</p><p>"Although at the time we didn't realise it was a requirement," the PFY says as an aside, nodding at the two department heads.</p><p>"The idea was magic!" I continue. "An administrative web page which would allow the users to tailor, start, stop, backup and recover the application without systems people's intervention. And the plan was good - right up until the new company decided that the hardware merger wouldn't be returning the expected gain in profit and so alternative vendors were sought."</p><p>"Vendors who could deliver a healthy additional profit," the PFY adds.</p><p>"Vendors who didn't know the meaning of the word expensive."</p><p>"Or reliable," the PFY again adds.</p><p>"So when the combined forces of HR and finance decided that they wanted this solution we suggested that the proposed hardware might not be great for a production system."</p><p>"And we were ignored," the PFY adds.</p><p>"And so we now have a situation where the disk hardware appears to be as unreliable as the server hardware."</p><p>"The server hardware can't be that unreliable - I can't remember the last time it went down," the head of HR says.</p><p>"That's because you don't use it all the time, AND because we have a master reset feature at our disposal."</p><p>"Master Reset?" the head of HR asks.</p><p>"Indeed. Follow."</p><p>The guild follow me into Mission Control and I show them the master reset system.</p><p>"Behold," I say pointing high above my head.</p><p>"Two pieces of string?" the Boss asks...</p><p>"Two pieces of string which go through the wall, through the comms room, through the comms room wall, across the computer room and down to the HR/Finance rack to one of two levers."</p><p>"Levers?"</p><p>"Yes, levers poised above the reset button on the servers. A quick pull on this and your servers go down faster than Paris."</p><p>"You can't be serious!" the Boss burbles.</p><p>"Sure am! I'm not wandering into the computer room three times a day to restart one of their machines!"</p><p>"Well give it a pull then," the head of HR says. "Because we're supposed to be doing a bank run for the salary payments and we've only got 23 minutes."</p><p>"I could give it a pull, but it's the disk that's crashed, not the machines. You want us to install a disk reset as well?"</p><p>"I... suppose so," the head of HR responds reluctantly.</p><p>"I'll get it," the PFY says, heading off to the computer room with a battery drill and a ball of string...</p><p>A few minutes later the PFY's back with a concerned look on his face.</p><p>"Yes?" the head of HR asks.</p><p>"The SAN was crapper than I thought - the reset button broke off when I pulled the lever and is wedged between the panel and a case so it's stuck in reset mode."</p><p>"Take the panel off then!" the head of HR gasps.</p><p>"It's riveted on!"</p><p>"Drill them out!" the head of HR snaps. "You've got 11 minutes!"</p><p>"Yeah well... I don't know that that's the best course of..."</p><p>"You're wasting time - just do it. You've only got 10 minutes now!"</p><p>...2 minutes later...</p><p>"I blame the manufacturer," I say to the PFY as I tap the front of the SAN.</p><p>"Yeah... security rivets with hardened faces on a piece of crap kit like this," the PFY says.</p><p>"I know. A shame the front panel isn't hardened though."</p><p>"Or the front of the chassis," the PFY says.</p><p>"Or the controller board," I add, gazing into the newly created hole in the now very dead SAN.</p><p>"Or all that cabling behind the controller board," the PFY says looking deep into the hole. "...So, back to Mission Control to fess up? I... Hello?"</p><p>...microseconds later, at the pub...</p><p>>ring< >ring< >ring< >ring<</p><p>"Leave that," I say to the Barman as he reaches for my cellphone helpfully. "It'll just be my assistant - about a technical matter."</p><p>"Technical matter?"</p><p>"Yeah, how to move faster than blame..."</p>
