            <br /><p></p><p>"What's the timeframe on the install of that videoconferencing device?" the Boss asks, bowling into Mission Control, dressed, as the saying goes, like a pox doctor's clerk.</p><p>"Yeah, good," the PFY says looking up from the assorted pieces of hardware on his desk.</p><p>"No, I wanted the timeframe till it's in place, not a status."</p><p>"Oh right. Well I guess it'll be sorted inside of a week"</p><p>"A week?! But I was told it'd arrived yesterday!"</p><p>"Yep, so it'll be all installed and configured in a week."</p><p>"But you told me that it was a turnkey device, all you'd need to do is give it a network address?"</p><p>"Uh-huh, and we'll do that when we rack it up."</p><p>"Can't you rack it up now?"</p><p>"Not really. I mean it's going to take at least a day to put it back together."</p><p>"Put it back together?!" the Boss gasps. "Why? What was wrong with it?"</p><p>"Nothing," the PFY says. "We just wanted to see how it works. It's quite good too - it boots off >tap< >tap< this hard drive here, but it's also got a slot for a flash card if you want to make it truly solid state. The kernel's a tiny Linux jobby that does a stack of sanity checking before handing off to the application. You can also set a jumper on this >tap< IO Card to tell the box to silently encode all conferences to one of the two drives in this >tap< >tap< media bay. AND it's got three NICs with inbuilt spike suppression, truly redundant power and the ability to battery backup to RAM >tap< here to hibernate the device should you wish to move it and boot it quickly in a portable configuration!"</p><p>"You... took it to bits?!" The Boss finally gasps.</p><p>"Yeah, but we take all new kit to bits!"</p><p>"But it says 'no user serviceable parts inside'!" the Boss says, pointing at a small label on the lid.</p><p>"Yeah, that's just what they tell you to keep you stupid," the PFY responds. "Besides, we're not users."</p><p>"But you've voided the warranty!"</p><p>"Nah, they'll never know we've been in there, we'll rivet the case back up when we're done."</p><p>"Rivet?"</p><p>"Yeah, we drilled the original rivets out - they tried to make it tamperproof."</p><p>"They'll know you drilled it out!"</p><p>"No they won't, it'll look mint!" the PFY says, brushing some metal shavings off the case.</p><p>"There's a great big gouge out of the side!"</p><p>"Yeah, I sent a complaint in to the vendor saying it came like that. That way if it claps out we'll just claim it was damaged in transit."</p><p>"They'll check the box!"</p><p>"This box?" the PFY asks, pointing at a box with a large number of boot marks in it.</p><p>"But they'll still know you opened the machine!"</p><p>"Nah they won't. The final assembly work is performed in Leeds - probably so that the company can bypass some import tariff or the other - so all we have to do is make it look like the last person who had it open was from Leeds."</p><p>"And how do you propose to accomplish that?"</p><p>"Smear the lid with lardy fingerprints and drop a couple of chips and some pork scratchings inside the case."</p><p>"I..."</p><p>"Oh, I almost forgot. I'll slip a bootleg of some blurry porn into the DVD drive."</p><p>"Uh... why?"</p><p>"That way they'll know it's been inspected by quality control."</p><p>"You can't seriously believe..."</p><p>. . . A week later . . .</p><p>"And so we took it out of the box and it's a complete DOA," the PFY says to the engineer, as the Boss looks on nervously.</p><p>"Let's just have a look at it then," the engineer says. "It's probably just a power supply fault."</p><p>>rattle<</p><p>"Have you opened this case?" he asks suspiciously.</p><p>"You can open it?" the PFY says. "How?"</p><p>"No, no, you can't open it, it must have got damaged in transit," the engineer says.</p><p>The PFY points to the Box and the engineer nods.</p><p>"It's the shipping agent we use in the factory up north," he says, shaking his head. "Used to be a baggage handler at Heathrow. Okay, lets just open her up."</p><p>. . . a couple of drillings later . . .</p><p>"Ah, it's the daughterboard," he says, pointing. "It's plugged in one row of pins to the left of when it should be."</p><p>"What's that for?" the PFY asks, pointing at a chip laying in the case.</p><p>"I... uhhh, that's just some packing," the engineer bluffs.</p><p>"It looks like a potato chip."</p><p>"Yeah, but it's not. It's one of those enviro carbon things. They're made out of... biomass and hexofibre - good for the atmosphere. And there's another one."</p><p>He dumps the food into his pocket, shuts the lid and plugs the unit into a tiny debug console he's brought with him.</p><p>"Righty-ho," he says. "Let's see how she goes."</p><p>>click< >whirrrrr<</p><p>An image promptly appears on the debug device and a self test starts.</p><p>"All looks ok," the engineer said.</p><p>"So how did it get out of the factory like that?" the PFY says. "Isn't there supposed to be some form of testing?"</p><p>"Yeah well, there should be, but it's possible this one got overl..."</p><p>He stops abruptly as a flabby backside wobbles its way across the screen...</p><p>"...might have just been damaged in transit," he says, pushing the eject button hurriedly.</p><p>"So we're all sorted then?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"Yep, all up and running."</p><p>"Can I get you a coffee?" the Boss asks, as the device is powered down.</p><p>"Why not?" our engineer says.</p><p>. . .</p><p>"So have you learnt a lesson today?" I ask the PFY once they've both gone.</p><p>"I have," the PFY says. "Engineers get the best toys. That debug device of his is fantastic."</p><p>"It is," I say. "How do you think it works?"</p><p>"Only one way to find out!" he snaps, reaching for the drill...</p>
