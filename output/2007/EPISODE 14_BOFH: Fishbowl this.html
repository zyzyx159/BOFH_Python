            <br /><p></p><p>"You want to WHAT?!?!" the PFY gasps, beating me to the draw by microseconds.</p><p>"Move the computer room?" the Boss responds, surprised that there's any objection to his latest brainwave.</p><p>"You've got to be kidding!"</p><p>"Not at all," the Boss asks, still not aware of the enormous upheaval he's proposing. "I've been talking with the head of IT and the architect and they both agree - it's prime office space wasted."</p><p>"But it takes MONTHS to move a computer room â€“ properly," I respond.</p><p>"Why, we just need to fit out a room with a raised floor!"</p><p>"And air-conditioning."</p><p>"Yes, air-conditioning, we've thought of that. As space is a little limited we thought we'd install the unit in an alcove on the floor above and duct chilled air down into the room."</p><p>"What about UPS power?" the PFY chimes in.</p><p>"Can't we just leave the UPS here and run power down from it?" the Boss says.</p><p>"I doubt the people using the 'prime office space' will consider a 120KVA UPS with noisy inverters to be a desirable roommate."</p><p>"Point taken. I suppose we could move it to the sub basement and just get a smaller unit for the critical users left up here."</p><p>"Sorry, are you proposing we move as well?" I ask.</p><p>"Well yes - you'd need to be close to your machines wouldn't you?"</p><p>"THE SUB BASEMENT!" the PFY cries, having lost his love of dark, enclosed spaces during one of those weekend-in-a-lift practical joke sessions we enjoy so much.</p><p>"It makes perfect sense!" the Boss replies "A computer room has very few visitors - it doesn't need a second floor office space - and you don't even like visitors."</p><p>"We'd need fire suppression," I add.</p><p>"Not a worry, we can install that in the basement along with the air-conditioning. I've been promised three car park spaces in the basement to house air-conditioning and other services."</p><p>"Emergency lighting?"</p><p>"One at each end of the space."</p><p>"Offices?" I ask. "Assuming of course that you weren't proposing we work in the computer room itself."</p><p>"I... not a problem, we'll have an office built."</p><p>"Cabling?"</p><p>"What cabling?"</p><p>"The fibre and copper network cabling, the patch frames, the rack cabling."</p><p>"Oh... Do we really need them?"</p><p>"You mean could we fit wireless lan cards to every server and cover a wall with Wireless Access points?"</p><p>"I... yes."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Oh. So how long would it take to get the network installed?"</p><p>"You mean repatch the fibre and copper distribution components down there, put in PBE frames, fibre termination points, racks and rack cabling? A couple of months."</p><p>"I... guess that would be ok. It affects the time frame a little but it shouldn't be too bad - should we go and look at the room just in case we see anything else we might want to consider?"</p><p>. . . Five minutes and several unhappy gestures from the PFY later. . .</p><p>"So this is the room," the Boss says, showing us into a large clinically clean concrete room.</p><p>"It's big," I say.</p><p>"What's that smell?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Oh that, that's just a... two pot leak-sealing compound the contractors used to make the place completely watertight - because I knew you'd be concerned about leaks and flooding in a sub basement area," the Boss says smugly.</p><p>"So you've started work on this already without discussing it with us?"</p><p>"I... well yes, we're under a bit of pressure for the space so I thought I'd get a headstart by organising some of the work that I knew would be needed - like the leak sealing and the access for the air-conditioning - see up there?"</p><p>"Where?" the PFY asks, gazing into the roof space blankly.</p><p>"There, to the right. That hole corresponds with the alcove at the back of the car park where the bin normally sits. The bin will be moved outside and the air-conditioning and fire gear can be ducted through that hole into the room."</p><p>"Sorry, to go back to a previous point - you said something about pressure for space?"</p><p>"Uh... yes. Yes we need the space on the second floor - as soon as possible."</p><p>"For..."</p><p>"For a... uhhhm... video conferencing, multimedia and fishbowling centre," the Boss blurts.</p><p>"A multimedia centre!" the PFY cries. "You're planning on moving us so you can chat to mates and watch movies! Whose bright idea was that?"</p><p>"I... Well it's not like you interact with people anyway," the Boss says defensively.</p><p>"And let's face it," I add. "This is a greenfields computer suite - we could build the perfect computer room here."</p><p>"What?" the PFY gasps.</p><p>"It's perfect - below ground so not subject to wild variations in temperature, watertight so not prone to flooding, overhead services so we don't need to sacrifice valuable computer room space for non-computing use, isolated and secure - it's perfect!"</p><p>"PERFECT!?!?!"</p><p>"Sure - well, almost perfect. I think the aircon ducting run might be a little long from ceiling to underfloor though - a little lossy," I say, pulling a seemingly valid criticism out of my nether regions.</p><p>"It should be ok," the Boss says, not wanting to ask what the hell 'lossy' means.</p><p>"Are you sure - it's a little long. Have you got a measuring tape?"</p><p>"Sure," the Boss says, handing one over.</p><p>"Okay, I'll feed the tape down and can you just hold it about 200mm from the floor - where the subfloor would start."</p><p>"Okay then," the Boss says as the PFY and I exit.</p><p>. . . two minutes later . . .</p><p>"How's that?" the Boss asks from below us.</p><p>"Fantastic," I say. "11 feet three inches. And what's the size of the room again?"</p><p>"Thirty feet by twenty feet, why?"</p><p>"And what rate does water come out of one of these babies?" I say dropping the fire hose into the hole a little while the PFY turns the handle.</p><p>>GUSH!!!<</p><p>>rattle< >rattle< >RATTLE!!!<</p><p>"The door's stuck!!!" the Boss cries as the PFY pushes the bin back over the hole</p><p>>indistinct rattle<</p><p>"Completely watertight you say? So I guess he'll get to try that fishbowling going WAY ahead of schedule..." the PFY sighs.</p><p>. . .</p>
