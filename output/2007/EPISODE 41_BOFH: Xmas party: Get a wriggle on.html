            <br /><p></p><p>"Get a jiggle on," I tell the PFY as I clamber into the work vehicle, "or we'll be late."</p><p>"Take it easy," the PFY responds calmly. "Stacks of time. The place doesn't even open for another hour."</p><p>"Yeah, but it'll take us that long to get there!" I snap.</p><p>"I'm sure we'll be ok," the Boss says, clambering into the back seat. "It's not like they're going to drink the place dry before we get there."</p><p>"Don't you believe it!" I respond. "Black tie casino evenings with open bars tend to finish quite quickly – especially when half the attendees are on their fifth gin and tonic before the chips are handed out and a vendor is picking up the bar tab."</p><p>"Chips?" the boss asks.</p><p>"The CASINO evening," the PFY says. "Hence the tux and tie combo."</p><p>"Oh, I thought it was just very formal," the boss burbles. "How does it work?"</p><p>"You get chips at the door, gamble for a couple of hours, then they'll run an auction of goodies with your winnings."</p><p>"And by goodies he means stuff the vendor hasn't been able to shift for the past year or two."</p><p>"Like the iPod knockoff with tons more capacity but with a 3.5 inch internal drive."</p><p>"Hmmm," the Boss says decisively. "You'd better step on it then."</p><p>"Like I said," the PFY counters. "Take it easy. This baby is kitted out like the Bondmobile!"</p><p>"Are the guys across the road coming?" I ask.</p><p>"Who?" the Boss asks.</p><p>"The IT gits from the place across the road – some government outfit. Last year they managed to win big by both cheating and registering stacks of people as attending – so they had stacks of chips. So we need to get in before them!!!"</p><p>"It's all taken care of," the PFY says, pointing to a red button on the dash with a small legend underneath it.</p><p>"You fitted nitrous oxide to a work vehicle!!" I gasp. "Brilliant!"</p><p>Seconds later we're out of the basement car park and barrelling across town</p><p>...moments later...</p><p>"They’re behind us,"” the PFY says, looking in the rear-view.</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>"The guys from across the road."</p><p>"Where?"</p><p>"White van, a couple of cars back, I recognise the driver."</p><p>"So it is," I concur. "Lose them?"</p><p>"Not a worry," the PFY says, pressing another button on the dash which results in a sudden lowering of the vehicle.</p><p>"What was that?" the Boss gasps.</p><p>"I've adjusted the shock absorbers to street race specs, changed the computer's fuel injection parameters to peak performance and disabled the redline revs cut-out."</p><p>"Uhh... Call me paranoid, but I think they just did that too," I say, noticing a corresponding lurch from the van now immediately behind us.</p><p>"Don't panic," the PFY says, pointing to another non-standard button the dash board.</p><p>"What does it do?" I ask, noticing no helpful legend.</p><p>"It lowers the wheel well under the boot."</p><p>"And it's full of waste oil!" I gasp.</p><p>"No," the PFY says, hurt. "The boot's full of all hundreds of old install CDs. Once they hit the road..."</p><p>"Ah," I reply. "No traction. Well you'd better hit that or the nitrous soon, because they’re about to overtake.."</p><p>"Just a few more secs," the PFY says, pointing to the dual carriageway ahead “...any moment now... >WHOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSSHHHH< >SCREEEEEEEE<"</p><p>"THE BASTARDS HAVE GOT NITROS TOO!" I shout over the engine noise as the Boss almost wets himself and the Van behind us looms large in the back window "THEY'RE OVERTAKING!!!! >Crash< NO Hang on!!!"</p><p>"GOTTEM!" the PFY says smugly, taking his finger off the nitrous button as the van disappears into the rear-view in a cloud of tyre smoke...</p><p>"Not exactly," I say. "The CDs passed harmlessly under the middle of their vehicle”."</p><p>"Then what happened?"</p><p>"The spare tyre and wheel well didn't..."</p><p>"Ah," the PFY says. "Note to self: Lowered suspension affects the wheel well."</p><p>Moments the PFY pulls to a halt around the corner from the venue.</p><p>"You can't park here," the Boss snaps. "It's a no parking zone – we'll be towed!"</p><p>"I... don't have any cash for the meters."</p><p>"Right!" the Boss snaps. "I have - I'll drive."</p><p>"How about we meet you inside then?" the PFY suggests.</p><p>"Fine!" the boss snaps, getting behind the wheel.</p><p>Moments later we're inside grabbing our chips for the evening.</p><p>"May as well grab the Boss' chips while we're at it," I suggest, pointing out the Boss' name out to the woman at the desk.</p><p>"Sure," the PFY says. "And we should probably pick up the chips for our mates across the road."</p><p>"Their company?" the woman asks.</p><p>"They're with the Ministry of Defence," the PFY says. "I believe half of their party is... delayed..."</p><p>"And the other half?"</p><p>"Busy outside detaining a reckless driver with unnecessary force..." the PFY says.</p><p>..</p><p>"So Mr Bond," I say to the PFY as we watch the Boss being manhandled into an unmarked van outside. "What would you say to an ice cold lager?"</p><p>"Hello ice cold lager!!!!" the PFY burbles happily...</p>
