            <h3>EPISODE 30 </h3>
            <br /><p> "WHERE THE **F#@K** HAVE YOU BEEN?" the Boss screams at me the moment I try my key in the door to mission control.</p><p>"Uh... On holiday?" I respond, noting two things - (a) my key doesn't fit and (b) the door's new. "You should know, you signed the leave form! Or you could have asked the PFY."</p><p>"Oh I was on holiday too," the PFY says, bringing up the rear. "But he signed my leave form as well."</p><p>"That's uncommonly generous of you, letting us both off at the same time!" I say, turning to the Boss. "Now how do we get into our office?"</p><p>"It's not your office any more - we took on new Systems people when you abandoned the workplace."</p><p>"Abandoned the workplace? We were on leave - and you apparently signed both forms which means you must have known it!"</p><p>"I.. don't recall any such thing! In any case, it's just bloody irresponsible for you both to go on holiday at the same time without being contactable."</p><p>"I had my mobile with me," I counter.</p><p>"I tried it and got no response!"</p><p>"Well, coverage in the third world is always a bit dodgy..."</p><p>"Really?" the PFY responds. "Where did you go, Luton?"</p><p>"Luton, Hull and Glasgow. A package hole-iday"</p><p>"You didn't drink the water did you?"</p><p>"Hell no, my interpreter warned me about that!"</p><p>"LOOK!" the Boss interrupts. "We were talking about you two not being needed any longer. We've replaced you!"</p><p>"Oh, right!" the PFY says. "Okay then, if you'll just organise the cheques we'll be on our way."</p><p>"What cheques?"</p><p>"The contract severance cheques - in our contract...?"</p><p>"Contract?"</p><p>"Our contract with the company," I explain helpfully. "Premature termination of the rolling contract outside of a negotiation period incurs a penalty payment equivalent to the remaining period plus one full period of the rolled-on contract."</p><p>"Which means?"</p><p>"You'd have to pay us a full year plus the six or so weeks left in this contract."</p><p>"Unless I wait six weeks for the 'negotiation period' then decide not to renew your contract..."</p><p>"You could do that, yes, but who'd run the systems?"</p><p>"The two new guys. They're permanent staff - much cheaper than contractors!"</p><p>"And you seriously think they'll still be here in six weeks?"</p><p>"I wouldn't even put money on six minutes!" the PFY says helpfully.</p><p>"Well we can't get rid of them!" as the two geeks in question roll up.</p><p>. . . Two minutes and a very quick recce later . . .</p><p>"I can't say I like what you've done with the place" I say to one of the geeks. "Where's the tape safe door?"</p><p>"We had to cut it off to get to the backup tapes because no one could find the keys - like we had to break down the door to this room because it didn't use the building keying system."</p><p>"Just ensuring data protection on site with enhanced physical security," I comment.</p><p>"If it's that protected why weren't there any tapes in the safe?"</p><p>"That's the first place a corporate spy would look."</p><p>"So where ARE the backup tapes?"</p><p>"In boxes in the storeroom marked 'Asbestos ceiling tiles'."</p><p>"WE GOT AN ENVIROMENTAL PROTECTION GROUP TO DUMP THEM!" the second geek gasps.</p><p>"I see. And the financials archive media?"</p><p>"What archive media?"</p><p>"About a hundred DVDs which used to be in a bin in the corner marked 'Used Needles, dispose of with care'."</p><p>"Why the hell would you put backups in there!?!"</p><p>"Again, Data security. I mean, who in their right mind would go fossicking around in there? And where's the Dilbert doll from my monitor?"</p><p>"We probably threw it out when we cleaned up."</p><p>"Not thinking as you did so that it was rather heavy for a doll - to the tune of a set of tape safe keys?"</p><p>"You should have been more careful with them," the first geek snaps.</p><p>"So you cut the door off a ten grand fireproof tape safe, dumped about five grand worth of backup tapes, then destroyed the company's financial archives and you're giving me suggestions about due care?"</p><p>"YOU SHOULD HAVE USED THE TAPE SAFES!!" the geek shouts.</p><p>"And what would the tapes have looked like after someone had thermal lanced the door off the safe?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>"But more importantly, how long have you worked for our opposition?"</p><p>"What?!?" the geeks, Boss and PFY say in unison.</p><p>"Well look at the facts, they've destroyed our backups, archives and tape safe and have probably not taken any backups since..."</p><p>"WE HAD TO BUY NEW TAPES!" the first geek cries.</p><p>"And, if I'm not mistaken, have isolated the fire suppression system in preparation for the tragic workplace fire...."</p><p>"IT'S HALON, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE IT ANY MORE!"</p><p>The PFY and I raise our eyebrows at the Boss wordlessly.</p><p>"GET ME SECURITY!"</p><p>Ah, it's great to be back in the saddle again.
