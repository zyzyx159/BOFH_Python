            <h3>EPISODE 20 </h3>
            <br /><p> 
Bright white light surrounds me and ahead I see a lift with the UP button greyed out. Entering the lift, I press the only option available, 'B', and go down.</p><p>The air gets appreciably warmer.</p><p>Exiting the lift, I see nine rooms. The one immediately in front of me has an endless pile of service packs which have to be applied to an endless line of Windows desktop machines.</p><p>The room next to it has a sign which says: "Discussion: Linux v Windows v MacOsX".</p><p>Far off in the distance in the last room I see a figure encased in ice.</p><p>Things become clearer.</p><p>I rush back to the lift, press the 'G' button noting the '1' button is still greyed out. And after all my selfless works, too.</p><p>The lift doors open and I head immediately for the light...</p><p>"We've got a pulse!" a paramedic yells as I regain a bit of my former consciousness. I notice the PFY halfway across the room in a similar state of recovery and the Boss in a corner with a couple of meds working on him. I catch a brief murmur of brain damage and manage to spit out something about it being his normal operating mode...</p><p>"What happened?" the PFY gasps once the pushing and shoving has stopped.</p><p>"I..." the Boss blubs, before lapsing into shocked silence.</p><p>"I..." I say, coming to a halt when I realise I have no recollection of what's transpired.</p><p>or... It might be a dream but I seem to remember...</p><p>. . .</p><p>"IT'S NOT THE BLOODY SAME!" I shout, annoyed. "I ordered a PARTICULAR machine in a PARTICULAR configuration so that it can perform a PARTICULAR task!"</p><p>"But this machine is the same," the Boss responds, calmly. "See, everything in the same amounts. It's a perfectly good substitute."</p><p>"You can't substitute a machine with a fast processor for a crap machine with two much slower processors! When I order a machine with two hard drives I don't want a machine with one LARGE hard drive!!!"</p><p>"If I may," the PFY says, interjecting. "I think I see the root of the problem."</p><p>"Mmm?" the Boss and I say almost simultaneously.</p><p>"You think the systems are basically the same."</p><p>"They are," the Boss says.</p><p>"Only you're not paid to think. If you were you'd be getting paid a lot less."</p><p>FIGHTING TALK FROM THE PFY!!!!</p><p>"I beg your pardon?!!"</p><p>"As well you should - this isn't the first time. Last week I ordered a couple of replacement mice for the console system and instead of the five button optical jobbies I ordered I got a FOUR button trackball - one with a ball which isn't even bloody spherical."</p><p>"But the ones you specified were 30 quid each. The alternatives cost us a tenth of that!!!"</p><p>"THEY DON'T BLOODY WORK PROPERLY!"</p><p>"But they've saved money!" the Boss bleats.</p><p>"YOU DON'T SAVE MONEY IF IT'S DODGY!" the PFY snaps. "And then this morning I receive this..."</p><p>"It's a keyboard."</p><p>"Yes it is. A PC keyboard with a Dec-VT220 configuration. NO-ONE USES THEM ANY MORE!"</p><p>"But it was only five quid!"</p><p>"BECAUSE IT'S CRAP!"</p><p>"Has this been happening with all our orders?" I ask, looking suspiciously at the recently delivered, yet still unopened package on my desktop.</p><p>"Uh... We have an agreement with stores that if we can find an equivalent for less or a better item for the same price we should do that. And the stuff they get is perfectly reputable and not at all... dodgy."</p><p>"And the person who's deciding what an equivalent product is the same person who picks his nose and eats it to save on lunch money?"</p><p>"He's saved us thousands already!"</p><p>"So it HAS been happening with all our orders?"</p><p>"Yes. Didn't we... uh.. tell you about that?" the Boss asks, faking innocence.</p><p>"So when I open up this package I'm not going to find the Taser.... uh... Insulation Testing Device I ordered?"</p><p>"You might. Or it might be a perfectly workable substitute."</p><p>. . .</p><p>"THIS ISN'T WHAT I ORDERED!!!" I snap angrily as I open the package and find a box with strange lettering on the side.</p><p>"No, it's a 'better' model" the PFY says, looking at the box. "East European. Higher voltage - unlimited battery life - at least that's what I think it says."</p><p>"East European?" the Boss asks confusedly.</p><p>"Yes..."</p><p>"Would you care to revise your story about dodginess?" I ask the Boss...</p><p>"No, I'm sure it's an excellent substitute."</p><p>"Well" the PFY says, scanning the pictures. "It looks like you turn it on here >click<, put the safety link in here >HUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM< and you control the withdrawal of the carbon rods here..."</p><p>"Carbon rods?" I ask, stepping back slightly as the ready LED goes from dull to bright red, then to white, then off with a puff of smoke.</p><p>"Does uh... anyone else smell burning?" the Boss asks, backing away slightly.</p><p>"Still think it's not a bit dodgy?" I ask the Boss.</p><p>"...and it looks like," the PFY continues engrossed in picture translation, "it's activated by pushing this button over h..." Â®</p>
