            <h3>EPISODE 1 </h3>
            <br /><p> "Where the hell have you been?!" the Boss snaps as I open the door to Mission Control, letting the PFY in before me.</p><p>He almost sounds angry!</p><p>"Yes," I reply, turning to the PFY. "Where the hell have you been?"</p><p>"I'm talking to you!" the Boss adds.</p><p>"Yes," I say, still talking to the PFY. "So listen up!"</p><p>"Not him, you!" the Boss shouts.</p><p>"Me?" I ask, oozing innocence. At least I think it's innocence. Actually, it might be... No, no, it's innocence.</p><p>"Yes. Where have you been?"</p><p>"Uh... Holiday?" I suggest.</p><p>"I know you were on holiday, but why weren't you back till today?"</p><p>"Because..... I.... was.... on..... holiday.....?" I say. Look into my eyes, look into my eyes, the eyes, the eyes, not around the eyes, don't look around the eyes, look into my eyes... >click< you're under. I've been on holiday. >click< and you're back in the room.</p><p>"I know you've been on bloody holiday! But what were you doing on holiday?"</p><p>"Drinking? Resting? A bit of light engineering on the Myford? Day trips with the Mrs?"</p><p>"No, I mean WHY were you on holiday?"</p><p>"Uh.. to drink, rest, do a bit of li..."</p><p>"WHY WAS NO-ONE HERE?!"</p><p>"Uhh... My able assistant was here..."</p><p>"NO HE BLOODY WASN'T!"</p><p>"Really?" I ask.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>"So Systems and Networks were locked up like a drum?"</p><p>"YES!"</p><p>"I see. And what broke?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"What did you need urgently - which broke while we were away - that's annoyed you?"</p><p>"Well, nothing really."</p><p>"I see. So you're annoyed because nothing broke? I mean we can fix that in no time!"</p><p>"No! No, I'm annoyed because no-one was here!"</p><p>"And nothing broke. So instead of being pleased that we have a reliable and robust infrastructure you're going to labour the whole being-on-site point?"</p><p>"Look, I'm not going to argue with you. You were supposed to be here and you weren't. In fact according to the contract we have with you, you're supposed to give a week's notice of any absence outside of emergencies."</p><p>"Well maybe this was an emergency?" the PFY suggests.</p><p>"And what emergency would that be?"</p><p>"Death in the family," the PFY says, thinking furiously of a less-than-loved relative who could be used at short notice to substantiate this claim.</p><p>"As I thought, nothing. So I'm sorry, but I'm going to raise this as a breach of contract."</p><p>"But it's only a breach of our contract if we didn't inform you."</p><p>"You didn'.t"</p><p>"Of course we did. And you okayed it"</p><p>"No I didn't!"</p><p>"Of course you did, and I have the email to prove it. Or at least I will before you get back to your office. In fact, it's probably also in your online dairy! You may even >clickety< have even agreed to extend my holiday and allow me to telecommute for the rest of January."</p><p>"I think he said we both could >clickety<," the PFY says. "Yes, here it is... dated December the >clickety< 19th."</p><p>"HAH!" the Boss says. "BUSTED! The 19th was a Sunday! And I was at my wife's sister's birthday in Hull!"</p><p>">clickety< Well it looks like the swipe card access logs would disagree with you. You were in several times that day to talk to us. >clickety< >tap< >tap< >clickety< Our meetings are even recorded on the CCTV Surveillance system. Which reminds me, we'd best fill in our overtime for that day. How many hours did we work?"</p><p>"27," the PFY replies.</p><p>"You can't work 27 hours in one day!" the Boss snaps.</p><p>"Ordinary people can't," the PFY says. "But you're right, we must have worked >clickety< two days."</p><p>"Good grief! >clickety<," I add. "So we did - but if that's the case then we would have worked more than ten consecutive days!"</p><p>"Of course!" the PFY says. "The penalty clause."</p><p>"What penalty clause?" the Boss sighs, knowing he's about to be shafted.</p><p>"The penalty clause in the contract to prevent you working us unreasonably. Isn't it something like a week's paid leave?"</p><p>"Indeed it is."</p><p>"This is preposterous - anyway, you won't have a contract once your unnotified absence is brought to light."</p><p>"What unnotified absence?"</p><p>>clickety<</p><p>"Last week."</p><p>"But we were here last week >clickety< >tap< even the cctv cameras agree," I say, turning my monitor to show him. "See, the newspaper on the visitor's table has a headline from last week on it."</p><p>"As opposed >clickety<," the PFY adds, "to the paper on the desk when you supposedly came in last week - which is from months ago. Looks like someone has made a crude attempt to prove that you were in. I bet >clickety< there's no history of you even coming into the building - apart from this morning..."</p><p>"I..."</p><p>"Or we could just take that penalty clause week's holiday and forget the whole thing?" I suggest.</p><p>"I.."</p><p>"Excellent. See you next week then." ®</p><p>BOFH is copyright © 1995-2005, Simon Travaglia. Don't mess with his rights.</p>
