            <h3>EPISODE 36 </h3>
            <br /><p></p><p>There's nothing like a workplace on Boxing Day! Sure, it's deader than a dead thing on a bank holiday and anyone with a life would be doing something else, but this is where the year is prepared for...</p><p>First job is cleaning up the debris in the cafeteria - which is quite a task after several cases of anonymously donated cheap bubbly arrived on the premises on the last day and were immediately consumed by the staff, resulting in a bit of... untidiness.</p><p>Once that's done I abuse my heightened level of access to the building to snaffle all the personal and company digital cameras I can find, putting each in it's own carefully labelled brown envelope.</p><p>...</p><p>"What're they for?" the PFY asks, scaring the crap out of me in the all but abandoned building as I sneak back into a darkened Mission Control.</p><p>"What are what for?" I ask, slipping the bag of cameras behind me.</p><p>"The bag of cameras behind your back," the PFY says, tapping the CCTV console feed.</p><p>Bugger, I'll have to make him an accomplice...</p><p>"It's... my annual incriminating evidence gathering mission."</p><p>"?"</p><p>"Every year there's a Christmas party and every year people do some inadvisable things."</p><p>"So?"</p><p>"In the past some of these things were lucky enough to be recorded on the CCTV system, but in these days of biometrics and enhanced burden of proof the leverage of a poor quality black and white image isn't what it once was."</p><p>"Oh I'm fairly sure the authorities could base a case on what I've recorded this morning..." the PFY hints.</p><p>"Be that as it may, I'm after bigger fish. Last year I left disposable cameras in strategic places in the hope that they'd be used to capture 'magic moments', but I was sadly disappointed."</p><p>"So you're stealing people's digital cameras to make up for it?"</p><p>“No. They'll be returned to their place of origin once I've accessed the flash memory”</p><p>"FLASH memory being the operative word” the PFY comments, winking.</p><p>... Half an hour later ...</p><p>"Well that was a bust!" the PFY says, looking at the collections of images. "Hardly blackmail material, is it?"</p><p>“Yes, well, finding incriminating evidence was the original plan but it occurred to me that with a bit of memory retardant the authenticity of reality could be challenged."</p><p>“And translated into English this means?"</p><p>"I realised that finding images was a crap plan. A far better plan would involve them finding incriminating images..."</p><p>“Yes but there aren't any” the PFY explains slowly.</p><p>“I think you mean there aren't any yet.” I say, firing up Photoshop...</p><p>“But they'll know they're fakes!”</p><p>“No, they'll probably just hope they're fakes.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“In the week prior to Christmas I invested heavily in an end-of-line champagne substitute known by some as Château de legopener, sending several cases to the Company under a pseudonym. I'm sure you witnessed the effects..”</p><p>“So you're suggesting that most people won't remember what they did?”</p><p>“I'm suggesting there might be a grey area or two which could be filled by an image or two from Doctor Bastard's Lab!!!”</p><p>“Will it work?”</p><p>“Of course. I take all the images from the cameras >clickety<, feed them into the morph package, >click< add a bit of anonymous porn, select our... victim.. and Viola!”</p><p>“Nothing happened!” the PFY says.</p><p>“Of course not, it takes about two hours an image – but time well spent, I assure you!”</p><p>. . . three days later . . .</p><p>“I'm a little... disturbed by some images that were printed on our colour printer,” I say to The Boss. “Images, what images?” he asks – in a hunted tone.</p><p>“Uh.. I'm not sure how you would describe them.. Candid snaps maybe? Only they look to have come from your workstation late in the afternoon on the 23rd....”</p><p>“There's nothing on my camera,” he blurts.</p><p>“I didn't suggest there was,” I counter. “Although one of them does feature you. Well, a part of you.”</p><p>“Yes, yes, well just throw the print-outs away. Or actually I'll throw them away!”</p><p>“Yeah, I could do that but the company has a policy about images of this nature – who to notify, how to gather evidence for the disciplinary process, etc.”</p><p>“Disciplinary Process! Surely it's none of the company's business,” the Boss blurts. “Can't you just.. pretend you didn't see anything?” “Oh, you mean act as if I hadn't seen you in the photograph – the same way you could act as if you didn't see the bottom line of the expenses claim I'm about to present.”</p><p>“So we're talking blackmail?”</p><p>“Really? I didn't notice one – although I wasn't looking too carefully. I could check the prints...”</p><p>And just like that the Boss is a broken man, signing any form we put in front of him - It's almost too easy. While he's contemplating the possibility that he's been living a lie I make a quick call to ensure that the expenses claims will get processed in the next pay run.</p><p>“I'm afraid the close-off date for the next run has passed,” the Accounts woman informs me.</p><p>“Can't you make an exception for me?” I ask.</p><p>“I don't think so.”</p><p>“So it's only your Boss you make exceptions for – giving him his.... Christmas present early... so to speak."</p><p>“What do you mean?” She asks, taking on the Boss's hunted tone.</p><p>“I think you know."</p><p>“I..."</p><p>“..think you can make an exception after all?”</p><p>“I'll get right onto it”</p><p>“Course you will...”</p><p>Yeah, it is too easy. ®</p>
