            <h3>EPISODE 23 </h3>
            <br /><p> "What do you two know about business intelligence?" the Boss asks the PFY and I after we answer the call for a quick chat at his request...</p><p>"A novel idea but I don't think it'll catch on," the PFY responds.</p><p>"Sorry?" The boss burbles, missing the PFY's point.</p><p>"Business & Intelligence - bit of a misnomer," the PFY replies helpfully.</p><p>"No, I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about obtaining information about our competitors."</p><p>"Oh, you mean spying," I reply.</p><p>"Well not spying exactly, I just mean obtaining information from their systems."</p><p>"Yes we call that spying. Corporate Espionage if you want to give it a flashy name."</p><p>"Uh... Be that as it may," the boss chirps, tapping a pencil on his desk impatiently, "I'd like to know what you know about it."</p><p>"Well you've come to the right place," I cry, "as my assistant here used to work for MI5."</p><p>"No I didn't!" the PFY sighs dryly.</p><p>"Well he's bound to say that isn't he?" I say, nodding knowingly at the boss, "it's all part of the training."</p><p>"No it's not!"</p><p>"Ah, so you do know what the training is then??" I ask, turning back to the Boss. "But seriously, he was. His code number was double-oh F."</p><p>"00F?"</p><p>"Yeah, they switched to Hexadecimal when the digits ran out."</p><p>"Ridiculous!" the PFY snaps.</p><p>"No, ridiculous was the first attempt using Dewey Decimal. By the time you'd finished warning them that you were 'secret agent double-oh 327.1PFY' they'd have already lowered you into the vat of acid and organised dinner for two followed by dancing with Moneypenny."</p><p>"I... Look, I'm not talking about that!!" The Boss interrupts. "What I'm wanting to know is IF we happened to come by the laptop of a staff member of another company would you be able to access any information from it?"</p><p>"And by IF you mean you already have?"</p><p>"Uh... Well we had a couple of drinks to celebrate a successful end to some legal action between our two companies and he inadvertently left his laptop behind at the pub..."</p><p>"And by access any information you actually mean find out the name and address of the owner so that you can return it to him?"</p><p>"I..."</p><p>"Because to do otherwise would be wrong."</p><p>"And possibly illegal," the PFY adds.</p><p>"Oh. I see."</p><p>"Of course if, in the process of obtaining the name and address information we happened to encounter some information that pertained to some business activity..."</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"We'd be obliged to keep the confidence of the party concerned."</p><p>"Oh," the Boss sighs unhappily.</p><p>"Of course, I'm not much of a poker player and I might let slip something I'd seen if you were discussing something that I had knowledge of."</p><p>"Not much of a poker player..." the boss repeats slowly.</p><p>"Especially when he's been drinking," the PFY chips in.</p><p>"So if we buy you drinks you'll break into the machine?"</p><p>"By George, I think he's got it!!!"</p><p>"Ok then. How do you plan to do it?"</p><p>"I'm not - I'll get the PFY to do it - he can sniff a breast out of a hard drive at thirty paces."</p><p>"I don't want porn, I want the business info!"</p><p>"Yes, yes, but the PFY will break into the machine to get the porn and we can get the other stuff."</p><p>"What if he hasn't got porn on his machine?"</p><p>"Puleese. Even blind people look at porn. That's why they make the braille keyboards washable!"</p><p>"I.. ... ..! Well I've never browsed porn!" the Boss gasps, offended.</p><p>"Yuh-huh. Yeah, you and Ghandi - because he's dead."</p><p>"I don't."</p><p>"Really well just to be on the safe side, do you want the PFY to check your machine? Even deleted files! He can suck a thumbnail out of a two-month-old deleted zip file..."</p><p>"I don't think that will be necessary," the boss counters hastily. "So what sort of software does he use?"</p><p>"Software?!" the PFY asks "Oh! Yes... uh... software."</p><p>"You don't use software?"</p><p>"It's like a sixth sense" I explain to the Boss. "Someone a couple of rooms away visits www.DirtyNunHosemonsters.com and he's straight into the webcache to grab copies"</p><p>"Really?!"</p><p>"Oh yeah. But he's got some quality control problems. He can detect porn but he can't detect what kind of porn - which can be a little disturbing at times. For instance last week when one of our part timers discovered a fetish for geriatrics."</p><p>"I'll never look at a rumpled mattress the same way again," the PFY whimpers.</p><p>"He'll probably need counselling," I whisper to the Boss. "But meantime, that's not getting us into the box. Where is it?"</p><p>"Uh.. here" the Boss says, removing the aforementioned machine from his briefcase guiltily.</p><p>"Ooooh!" the PFY says. "I sense a stirring in the force!"</p><p>"So long as it's just the force," I warn.</p><p>"Can I..." the PFY asks, reaching for the machine eagerly.</p><p>The Boss hands the machine over to the PFY and he takes off like a shot.</p><p>"So how long do you think it will take?" the boss asks ten minutes later, tapping his foot anxiously. "Because sooner or later I'm going to get a call from the owner."</p><p>"Well it's a complex thing, bypassing Windows security. I mean you'll have to boot from a CD..."</p><p>"Yes, and then?"</p><p>"That's pretty much it."</p><p>"So he'll have got into the machine?"</p><p>"I'm not too sur..."</p><p>"Got it!" the PFY says, popping back into the room cheerfully with a pack of smokes in his hand.</p><p>"Excellent! Are there any financial documents?"</p><p>"Oh right, you wanted the work stuff!" he says, popping back out again...</p><p>Something tells me it's going to be a long day... Â®</p>
