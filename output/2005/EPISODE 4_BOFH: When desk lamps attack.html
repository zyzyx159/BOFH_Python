            <br /><p> "Yeah, I was just ringing because I can't install an application on my machine."</p><p>"Really?" I ask. "What application?"</p><p>"Oh that's not important, but what is important is that I don't seem to have Administrator access to my machine."</p><p>"Yes, that's right, no-one does. Well, that's not completely true, myself and my assistant do, and the support staff have 'Power User' access."</p><p>"But it's my machine!"</p><p>"No, it's the Company's machine - you're just using it."</p><p>"The company bought the machine for me!"</p><p>"For you to USE, yes. Like your desk."</p><p>"Ah, but I can install stuff on my desk!"</p><p>"Sorry?"</p><p>"I can install stuff on my desk - like a desk lamp!"</p><p>"You already have a desk lamp. A stainless steel one with the company crest. Anything else you might install could be dangerous!"</p><p>"You can't have a 'dangerous' desk lamp!"</p><p>"Yes you could. One that has the phase wire connected to the metal body instead of the earth wire would be dangerous."</p><p>"That's ridiculous, who'd make a lamp like that?!"</p><p>"My assistant, if you really annoyed him. And even then it'd be installed by a experienced systems administrator without your knowledge - like most good installations."</p><p>"You install stuff on our machines without telling us?"</p><p>"Yes, for security reasons."</p><p>"Oh you mean antivirus updates and service pack things?"</p><p>"Uh.... ok... yeah sure."</p><p>"What if I want to install something?"</p><p>"You mean like a piece of music playing software?"</p><p>"No, there's a jukebox player already installed, but yes."</p><p>"We don't permit that. I mean after all, it's a work machine. In fact I didn't realise that there was a jukebox application in the standard installation image. Must make a note of that."</p><p>"It's already installed, so there's nothing you can do about it!"</p><p>"Of course I can! I could even subcontract the job out to one of the more aggressive of the company's security team with a reputation for brutality and the personality of a serial killer, but that's not the way we do things around here."</p><p>"Oh," he sighs, danger averted.</p><p>"No, I'll just make a slight change to the group policy that will remove everyone's jukebox application, and when they ask, I'll tell them that it was you that brought it to my attention."</p><p>"I.. You wouldn't dare!"</p><p>>clickety<</p><p>"Already done!"</p><p>The next day the wheels fall off as there's a groundswell of support for the jukebox application from people like the Head of IT and the CEO who are among those inconvenienced by the removal.</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>I get the PFY to make the necessary reversals to the Group Policy then tell everyone to reboot, which causes the network to grind for a couple of hours.</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>Yet again the phone rings and I notice it's my troublemaker, so I take the call. Wouldn't you know it, he sounds a little pleased with himself...</p><p>"So ANYWAY," he smirks. "I'd like that administrative access to my machine now. Oh, and could you come and do it personally?"</p><p>"I think you're mistaking the battle for the war," I say. "We're still not permitting administrative access."</p><p>"I think you are!" he replies, pulling an ace from his sleeve. "I'd had a little meeting with the CEO and he agrees that I should be allowed to install the applications I need to do my job. Seeing as how you people seem to get confused by all those options."</p><p>Double sigh.</p><p>"Yeah... no I don't think so," I reply.</p><p>"But I insist," he chuckles. "Oh hang on, it's not me that's insisting, that's right, it's the C.E.O!"</p><p>I suppress the urge to ring the neanderthal in security and decide instead to deal with this in a much more adult manner - in keeping with my responsible image.</p><p>. . . the next day . . .</p><p>"I'm waiting..." my annoying user sighs down the phone at me</p><p>"What for, I've sorted everything out that you wanted."</p><p>"I haven't got admin rights to my machine!"</p><p>"Oh, ADMIN RIGHTS, of course!" I gasp. "I'm sorry, I must have got confused by all the options and installed a new desk lamp for you instead."</p><p>"I don't want a new desk lamp. Anyway, it's the same desk lamp!"</p><p>"Really? I thought your old desk lamp was a bit grubby. With a recently modified 'earthing' system. Sitting on the CEO's desk. Covered in your fingerprints - which, as you probably know, show up awfully well on stainless steel surfaces."</p><p>"What the hell's it doing th... I... ... You wouldn't!"</p><p>"Course not! Oh look >clickety< the lights have just gone out on the top floor. However will the CEO see what he's doing?"</p><p>"Ok, I don't need administrative rights!" he stutters, backpeddling like a madman.</p><p>"Wasting valuable CPR seconds here..."</p><p>>Clatter!<</p><p>"So did you really swap the lamps over?" the PFY asks.</p><p>"Nah, he left on a junket with his PA. But his office doorhandle's got some form of wiring problem that probably needs looki..."</p><p>A high-pitched scream punctuates the building</p><p>"Or maybe not," the PFY comments. ®</p><p>BOFH is copyright © 1995-2005, Simon Travaglia.
