            <br /><p> "You've got to be kidding!" the PFY slurs, putting down his glass of port. "It's Friday at 4:30 - you can't expect me to do anything!"</p><p>"It's just a quick job," the user gasps, extricating his laptop from his briefcase.</p><p>"Quick as in 'which is the space bar?' or quick as in reinstalling XP on your laptop including non-slipstreamed patches, Office and all your games from scratch?"</p><p>"No, no, there's just something a little screwy with it. It seems to work most of the time, but every now and then it runs a little slow."</p><p>"When did you last run a virus scan?"</p><p>"Every day!" he lies.</p><p>"And how often do you update your definitions?"</p><p>"Oh, it's set to automatic," he pinocchios.</p><p>"Uhuh, and when did you last plug it into the network?"</p><p>"Oh, I'd never plug it into the network!" he says.</p><p>"Then how do you update the virus definitions?" the PFY asks pointedly.</p><p>BUSTED!</p><p>"I.. Uh... Well it's automatic!"</p><p>"Or your machine is virus infected and you never update your definitions..."</p><p>"It's automatic!" he bleats.</p><p>"I think he's lying," I say, getting in on the act.</p><p>"I'm not!"</p><p>"So you'll be willing to submit to a lie detector test?"</p><p>"Uh.. ... ...Ok."</p><p>"Righto, pop your hand on this."</p><p>"What, the mouse pad?"</p><p>"MMmm Hmmm."</p><p>"It's just a mouse pad!"</p><p>"Ok then, so it won't matter if you put your hand on the pad, will it?"</p><p>"I... No, I guess not."</p><p>"Right. Comfy? Is your machine automatically set to update it's virus definitions?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Ok, lets see what the lie detector says about that answer..."</p><p>>click click<</p><p>We look across to the PFY's desktop, which has a window with the words "He's lying" in large red letters on the screen.</p><p>"Ooooh, doesn't look good for today's contestant!" the PFY blurts.</p><p>"I... Hey! It's just a Word document! You just opened a Word document called He's Lying.doc - you can see the name in the title bar!"</p><p>"The detector has spoken!" I cry loudly.</p><p>"It's a bloody word document! Ok, let me have a go and I'll open the one called He's telling the truth.doc."</p><p>"There's no such document" the PFY says. "We've never needed one. We've got a She's Lying.doc though."</p><p>"So you're saying all users are liars!?"</p><p>"Uhhm.. Yes."</p><p>"Well I'm not a liar!"</p><p>"And the detector says.... Oh, SHE'S lying. Is there something you neglected to reveal in the interview process which you'd like to get off your... chest... now?"</p><p>"This is preposterous! In any case I'd still like my machine fixed!" he says. "And I'd like it done before I go home!!"</p><p>"And I'd like Claudia Schiffer waiting for me at home with a magnum of lager, but it's not going to happen baby!" I say, refilling my glass. "So how about we settle for a compromise?"</p><p>"What sort of compromise?" the user asks.</p><p>"You walk away now."</p><p>"Yes, and...?" he asks.</p><p>"And.... that's it."</p><p>"Where's the compromise in that?"</p><p>"You'd still be able to walk," the PFY says.</p><p>. . . The following Monday . . .</p><p>"I've... got a complaint I'd like to talk to you about," the Boss says, cautiously.</p><p>"Really? What is it?"</p><p>"A user says that he came to you with a problem on Friday afternoon and he got less than satisfactory service."</p><p>"How so?"</p><p>"He says that he came to you and asked you to take a look at his machine because it was behaving strangely."</p><p>"Yes, with you so far?"</p><p>"And you didn't help him out."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Yes we did! In fact, I think we should call him now and sort this out!" the PFY blurts.</p><p>"Really?" the Boss says, surprised that it seems to be going so well.</p><p>"Most certainly. If someone believes they've had unsatisfactory service from us, it's the least we can do to find out what the story is!"</p><p>"Well if it helps get to the bottom of things."</p><p>>ring<</p><p>"Hello?"</p><p>"Hi, Systems and Networks here, just following up on a complaint you lodged with our manager."</p><p>"yyyes?"</p><p>"So it's your claim that your machine wasn't virus infected?" says the PFY motioning the boss over to his screen.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>>click click<</p><p>"And that you automatically update your definitions."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>>click click<</p><p>"And that you're a man, not a woman in drag?"</p><p>"WHAT?!"</p><p>"It's your claim that you're a man."</p><p>"Of course it is!"</p><p>>click click<</p><p>"And you feel that you were treated poorly?"</p><p>"Of course I was!"</p><p>"Ok, thanks for your time, someone will get back to you shortly."</p><p>"I can't believe it," the Boss says, looking up from the PFY's document. "He's a woman!!?!! Are you sure this thing is accurate?"</p><p>"Oh yes, we had it calibrated for voice stress last week when she rang asking for your number."</p><p>"My number?"</p><p>"Yes, apparently she fancies you!"</p><p>"What? I... Well.." the Boss burbles wandering out of Mission Control with a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>"The 'fancies you' bit was laying it on a little thick don't you think?"</p><p>"My thinking," the PFY counters, "is worst case scenario we lose one of them. Best case scenario, we lose both of them AND take a patent out on our lie-detecting mouse pads!!!"</p><p>"It's win-win isn't it?"</p><p>"You betcha!!!" Â®</p>
